ABSTRACT

The use of the iris and periocular region as biometric traits has been
extensively investigated, mainly due to the singularity of the iris fea-
tures and the use of the periocular region when the image resolution
is not sufﬁcient to extract iris information. In addition to providing
information about an individual’s identity, features extracted from
these traits can also be explored to obtain other information such as
the individual’s gender, the inﬂuence of drug use, the use of contact
lenses, spooﬁng, among others. This work presents a survey of the
databases created for ocular recognition, detailing their protocols
and how their images were acquired. We also describe and discuss
the most popular ocular recognition competitions (contests), high-
lighting the submitted algorithms that achieved the best results us-
ing only iris trait and also fusing iris and periocular region informa-
tion. Finally, we describe some relevant works applying deep learn-
ing techniques to ocular recognition and point out new challenges
and future directions. Considering that there are a large number of
ocular databases, and each one is usually designed for a speciﬁc
problem, we believe this survey can provide a broad overview of the
challenges in ocular biometrics.

1. INTRODUCTION

Several corporations and governments fund biometrics research due
to various applications such as combating terrorism and the use of
social networks, showing that this is a strategically important re-
search area [1, 2]. A biometric system exploits pattern recogni-
tion techniques to extract distinctive information/signatures of a per-
son. Such signatures are stored and used to compare and determine
the identity of a person sample within a population. As biometric
systems require robustness against acquisition and/or preprocessing
fails, as well as high accuracy, the challenges and the methodologies
for identifying individuals are constantly developing.
Methods that identify a person based on their physical or be-
havioral features are particularly important since such characteris-
tics cannot be lost or forget, as may occur with passwords or identity
cards [3]. In this context, the use of ocular information as a biomet-
ric trait is interesting regarding a noninvasive technology and also
because the biomedical literature indicates that irises are one of the
most distinct biometric sources [4].
The most common task in ocular biometrics is recognition,
which can be divided into veriﬁcation (1 : 1 comparison) and iden-
tiﬁcation (1 : n comparison). Also, recognition can be performed
in two distinct protocols called closed-world and open-world. In the
closed-world protocol, samples of an individual are present in the

2 eduluz@ufop.edu.br

3 alceu.junior@pucpr.br

training and test set. The open-world protocol must have samples
from different subjects both in the training and test sets. The identi-
ﬁcation process generally is performed on the closed-world protocol
(except the open-set scenario, which has imposters that are only in
the test set, i.e., individuals who should not match any subject in the
gallery set), while veriﬁcation can be performed in both, being the
open-world most common protocol adopted in this setup. In addi-
tion to identiﬁcation and veriﬁcation, there are other tasks in ocular
biometrics such as gender classiﬁcation [5], spooﬁng [6] and live-
ness [7] detection, recognition of left and right iris images [8], ocular
region detection [9, 10], iris/sclera segmentation [11, 12], and sensor
model identiﬁcation [13].
Iris recognition under controlled environments at near-infrared
wavelength (NIR) demonstrates impressive results, and as reported
in several works [3, 14–17] can be considered a mature technology.
The use of ocular images captured in uncontrolled environments is
currently one of the greatest challenges [18, 19]. As shown in Fig. 1,
such images usually present noise caused by illumination, occlusion,
reﬂection, motion blur, among others. Therefore, to improve the
biometric systems performance in these scenarios, recent approaches
have used information extracted only from the periocular region [20–
22] or fusing them with iris features [23–26].

ble wavelength (left) and CASIA-IrisV4-Thousand [28]: controlled
environment images at near-infrared wavelength (right).

The term periocular is associated with the region around the eye,
composed of eyebrows, eyelashes, and eyelids [36–38], as illustrated
in Fig. 2. Usually, the periocular region is used when there is poor
quality in the iris region, commonly in visible wavelength (VIS) im-
ages or part of the face is occluded (in face images) [22, 36].
In
the literature, regarding the periocular region, there are works that
kept the iris and sclera regions [18, 22, 39] and others that removed

Although there are several surveys in the literature describing
ocular recognition methodologies [3, 4, 29–35, 42, 43], such surveys
do not speciﬁcally focus on databases and competitions. Table 1
summarizes the number of ocular databases/competitions described
in these surveys.
One of the ﬁrst surveys on iris recognition was presented by
Wildes [4], who examined iris recognition biometric systems as well
as issues in the design and operation of such systems. Bowyer et
al. [3] described both the historical and the state-of-the-art devel-
opment in iris biometrics focusing on segmentation and recognition
methodologies. Addressing long-range iris recognition, the litera-
ture review described in [33] presents and describes iris recognition
methods at a distance system. Alonso-Fernandez et al. [31, 32] sur-
veyed methodologies focusing only on periocular biometrics, while
Rattani and Derakhshani [34] described state-of-the-art methods ap-
plied to periocular region, iris, and conjunctival vasculature recogni-
tion using VIS images. Lastly, Nigam et al. [30] described in detail
methodologies for speciﬁc topics such as iris acquisition, prepro-
cessing techniques, segmentation approaches, in addition to feature
extraction, matching and indexing methods.
This work describes ocular databases and competitions (or con-
tests) on biometric recognition using iris and/or periocular traits. We
present the databases according to the images that compose them,
i.e., NIR, VIS and Cross-Spectral, and multimodal databases. We
also detailed information such as image wavelength, capture en-
vironment, cross-sensor, database size and ocular modalities em-
ployed, as well as the protocol used for image acquisition and

database construction.
The main contributions of this paper are the following: (i) we
survey and describe the types of existing ocular images databases
and image acquisition protocols; (ii) a detailed description of the ap-
plications and goals in creating these databases; (iii) a discussion and
description of the main and most popular ocular recognition compe-
titions in order to illustrate the methodology strategies in each chal-
lenge; and (iv) we drawn new challenging tasks and scenarios in
ocular biometrics.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst survey speciﬁcally
focused on ocular databases and competitions. Thus, we believe that
it can provide a general overview of the challenges in ocular recog-
nition over the years, the databases used in the literature, as well
as the best performance methodologies in competitions for different
scenarios.
The remainder of this work is organized as follows.
In Sec-
tion 2, we detail the ocular databases separating them into three cat-
egories: NIR, VIS and cross-spectral, and multimodal databases. In
Section 3, we present a survey and discussion of ocular recogni-
tion competitions using iris and periocular region information and
describe the top-ranked methodologies. Section 4 presents recent
works applying deep learning frameworks to iris/periocular recog-
nition and also to other tasks regarding ocular biometrics. Finally,
future challenges and directions are pointed out in Section 5 and
conclusions are given in Section 6.

2. OCULAR DATABASES

Currently, there are various databases of ocular images, constructed
in different scenarios and for different purposes. These databases
can be classiﬁed by VIS and NIR images and separated into con-
trolled (cooperatives) and uncontrolled (non-cooperatives) environ-
ments, according to the process of image acquisition. Controlled
databases contain images captured in environments with controlled
conditions, such as lighting, distance, and focus. On the other hand,
uncontrolled databases are composed of images obtained in uncon-
trolled environments and usually present problems such as defocus,
occlusion, reﬂection, off-angle, to cite a few. A database contain-
ing images captured at different wavelengths is referred to as cross-
spectral, while a database with images acquired by different sensors
is referred to as cross-sensor. The summary of all databases cited
in this paper as well as links to ﬁnd more information about how
they are available can be found at [www.inf.ufpr.br/vri/

publications/ocularDatabases.html].

In this Section, the ocular databases are presented and orga-
nized into three subsections. First, we describe databases that con-
tain only NIR images, as well as synthetic iris databases. Then, we

present databases composed of images captured at both VIS and
cross-spectral scenarios (i.e., VIS and NIR images from the same
subjects). Finally, we describe multimodal databases, which contain
data from different biometric traits, including iris and/or periocular.

2.1. Near-Infrared Ocular Images Databases

Ocular images captured at NIR wavelength are generally used to
study the features present in the iris [14, 15, 28]. As even darker pig-
mentation irises reveal rich and complex features [44], most of the
visible light is absorbed by the melanin pigment while longer wave-
lengths of light are reﬂected [3]. Other studies can also be performed
with this kind of databases, such as methodologies to create synthetic
irises [45, 46], vulnerabilities in iris recognition and liveness detec-
tion [47–50], impact of contact lenses in iris recognition [51–54],
template aging [55, 56], inﬂuence of alcohol consumption [57] and
study of gender recognition through the iris [58]. The databases used
for these and other studies are described in Table 2 and detailed in
this session. Some samples of ocular images from NIR databases are
shown in Figure 3.

Fig. 3. From top to bottom: NIR ocular image samples from
the CASIA-IrisV3-Lamp [28], CASIA-IrisV3-Interval [28], ND-
CLD15 [54],
IIITD CLI [52, 59] and ND Cosmetic Contact
Lenses [53, 60] databases.

One of the ﬁrst iris databases found in the literature was cre-
ated and made available by CASIA (Chinese Academy of Science).
The ﬁrst version, called CASIA-IrisV1, was made available in 2002.
The CASIA-IrisV1 database has 756 images of 108 eyes with a
size of 320 × 280 pixels. The NIR images were captured in two
sections with a homemade iris camera [28].
In a second version
(CASIA-IrisV2), made available in 2004, the authors included two
subsets captured by an OKI IRISPASS-h and CASIA-IrisCamV2
sensors. Each subset has 1,200 images belonging to 60 classes
with a resolution of 640 × 480 pixels [28]. The third version of
the database (CASIA-IrisV3), made available in 2010, has a total of
22,034 images from more than 700 individuals, arranged among its
three subsets: CASIA-Iris-Interval, CASIA-Iris-Lamp and CASIA-
Iris-Twins. Finally, CASIA-IrisV4, an extension of CASIA-IrisV3
and also made available in 2010, is composed of six subsets: three
from the previous version and three new ones: CASIA-Iris-Distance,

3

CASIA-Iris-Thousand and CASIA-Iris-Syn. All six subsets together
contain 54,601 ocular images belonging to more than 1,800 real sub-
jects and 1,000 synthetic ones. Each subset will be detailed below,
according to the speciﬁcations described in [28].
The CASIA-Iris-Interval database has images captured under a
near-infrared LED illumination. In this way, these images are used
to study the texture information contained in the iris traits. The
database is composed of 2,639 images, obtained in two sections,
from 249 subjects and 395 classes with a resolution of 320 × 280
pixels.
The images from the CASIA-Iris-Lamp database were acquire
by a non-ﬁxed sensor (OKI IRISPASS-h) and thus the individual
collected the iris image with the sensor in their own hands. During
the acquisition, a lamp was switched on and off to produce more
intra-class variations due to contraction and expansion of the pupil,
creating a non-linear deformation. Therefore, this database can be
used to study problems such as iris normalization and robust iris fea-
ture representation. A total of 16,212 images, from 411 subjects,
with a resolution of 640 × 480 pixels were collected in a single sec-
tion.
During an annual twin festival in Beijing, iris images from
100 pairs of twins were collected to form the CASIA-Iris-Twins
database, enabling the study of similarity between iris patterns of
twins. This database contains 3,183 images (400 classes from 200
subjects) captured in a single section with the OKI IRISPASS-h cam-
era at a resolution of 640 × 480 pixels.
The CASIA-Iris-Thousand database is composed of 20,000 oc-
ular images from 1,000 subjects, with a resolution of 640 × 480 pix-
els, collected in a single section by an IKEMB-100 IrisKing cam-
era [66]. Due to a large number of subjects, this database can be
used to study the uniqueness of iris features. The main source of
intra-class variations that occur in this database is due to specular
reﬂections and eyeglasses.
The last subset of CASIA-IrisV4, called CASIA-IRIS-Syn, is
composed of iris images generated with iris textures automatically
synthesized from the CASIA-IrisV1 subset. The generation process
applied the segmentation approach proposed by Tan et al. [67]. Fac-
tors such as blurring, deformation, and rotation were introduced to
create some intra-class variations. In total, this database has 10,000
images belonging to 1,000 classes.
The images from the ND-IRIS-0405 [15] database were cap-
tured with the LG2200 imaging system using NIR illumination. The
database contains 64,980 images from 356 subjects and there are
several images with subjects wearing contact lenses. Even the im-
ages being captured under a controlled environment, some condi-
tions such as blur, occlusion of part of the iris region, and problems
like off-angle may occur. The ND-IRIS-0405 is a superset of the
databases used in the ICE 2005 [14] and ICE 2006 [15] competi-
tions.
The ICE 2005 database was created for the Iris Challenge Evalu-
ation 2005 competition [14]. This database contains a total of 2,953
iris images from 132 subjects. The images were captured under
NIR illumination using a complete LG EOU 2200 acquisition sys-
tem with a resolution of 480 × 640 pixels. Images that did not pass
through the automatic quality control of the acquisition system were
also added to the database. Experiments were performed indepen-
dently for the left and right eyes. The results of the competition can
be seen in [14].
The ICE 2006 database has images collected using the LG EOU
2200 acquisition system with a resolution of 480 × 640 pixels. For
each subject, two ‘shots’ of 3 images of each eye were performed
per session, totaling 12 images. The imaging sessions were held in

three academic semesters between 2004 and 2005. The database has
a total of 59,558 iris images from 240 subjects [15].
The WVU Synthetic Iris Texture Based database, created at
West Virginia University, has 1,000 classes with 7 grayscale images
each. It consists exclusively of synthetic data, with the irises being
generated in two phases. First, a Markov Random Field model was
used to generate the overall iris appearance texture. Then, a vari-
ety of features were generated (e.g., radial and concentric furrows,
crypts and collarette) and incorporated into the iris texture. This
database was created to evaluate iris recognition algorithms since, at
the time of publication, there were few available iris databases and
they had a small number of individuals [45].
The WVU Synthetic Iris Model Based database also consists of
synthetically generated iris images. This database contains 10,000
classes from 5,000 individuals, with degenerated images by a com-
bination of several effects such as specular reﬂection, noise, blur,
rotation, and low contrast. The image gallery was created in ﬁve
steps using a model and anatomy-based approach [46], which con-
tains 40 randomized and controlled parameters. The evaluation of
their synthetic iris generation methodology was performed using a
traditional Gabor ﬁlter-based iris recognition system. This database
provides a large amount of data that can be used to evaluate ocular
biometric systems.
The Fake Iris Database was created using images from 50 sub-
jects belonging to the BioSec baseline database [68] and has 800
fake iris images [47]. The process for creating new images is di-
vided into three steps. The original images were ﬁrst reprocessed to
improve quality using techniques such as noise ﬁltering, histogram
equalization, opening/closing, and top hat. Then, the images were

printed on paper using two commercial printers: an HP Deskjet
970cxi and an HP LaserJet 4200L, with six distinct types of papers:
white paper, recycled paper, photographic paper, high-resolution pa-
per, butter paper, and cardboard [47]. Finally, the printed images
were recaptured by an LG IrisAccess EOU3000 camera.
The IIT Delhi Iris database consists of 1,120 images, with a
resolution of 320 × 240 pixels, from 224 subjects captured with
the JIRIS JPC1000 digital CMOS camera. This database was cre-
ated to provide a large-scale database of iris images of Indian users.
In [61], Kumar and Passi employed these images to compare the
performance of different approaches for iris identiﬁcation (e.g., Dis-
crete Cosine Transform, Fast Fourier Transform, Haar wavelet, and
Log-Gabor ﬁlter) and to investigate the impact in recognition perfor-
mance using a score-level combination.
The images from the ND Iris Contact Lenses 2010 database were
captured using the LG 2200 iris imaging system. Visual inspections
were performed to reject low-quality images or those with poor re-
sults in segmentation and matching. To compose the database, the
authors captured 9,697 images from 124 subjects that were not wear-
ing contact lenses and 12,003 images from 87 subjects that were
wearing contact lenses. More speciﬁcally, the images were acquired
from 92 subjects not wearing lenses, 52 subjects wearing the same
lens type in all acquisitions, 32 subjects who wore lenses only in
some acquisitions and 3 subjects that changed the lens type between
acquisitions [51]. According to Baker et al. [51], the purpose of this
database is to verify the degradation of iris recognition performance
due to non-cosmetic prescription contact lenses.
The ND Iris Template Aging database, described and used by
Fenker and Bowyer [55], was created to analyze the template aging

4

in iris biometrics. The images were collected from 2008 to 2011 us-
ing an LG 4000 sensor, which captures images at NIR. This database
has 22,156 images, being 2,312 from 2008, 5,859 from 2009, 6,215
from 2010 and 7,770 from 2011, corresponding to 644 irises from
322 subjects. The ND-Iris-Template-Aging-2008-2010 subset be-
longs to this database.
All images from the ND TimeLapseIris database [56] were taken
with the LG 2200 iris imaging system, without hardware or software
modiﬁcations throughout 4 years.
Imaging sessions were held at
each academic semester over 4 years, with 6 images of each eye
being captured per individual in each session. From 2004 to 2008,
a total of 6,797 images were obtained from 23 subjects who were
not wearing eyeglasses, 5 subjects who were wearing contact lenses,
and 18 subjects who were not wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses in
any session. This database was created to investigate template aging
in iris biometrics.
To investigate the effect of alcohol consumption on iris recogni-
tion, Arora et al. [57] created the Iris Under Alcohol Inﬂuence (IIITD
IUAI) database, which contains 440 images from 55 subjects, with
220 images being acquired before alcohol consumption and 220 af-
ter it. The subjects consumed approximately 200 ml of alcohol in
approximately 15 minutes, and the second half of the images were
taken between 15 and 20 minutes after consumption. Due to alcohol
consumption, there is a deformation in iris patterns caused by the di-
lation of the pupil, affecting iris recognition performance [57]. The
images were captured using the Vista IRIS scanner at NIR wave-
length.
The IIITD Contact Lens Iris (IIITD CLI) database is composed
of 6,570 iris images belonging to 101 subjects. The images were
captured by two different sensors: Cogent CIS 202 dual iris sensor
and VistaFA2E single iris sensor with each subject (i) not wearing
contact lenses, (ii) wearing color cosmetic lenses, and (iii) wearing
transparent lenses. Four lens colors were used: blue, gray, hazel and
green. At least 5 images of each iris were collected in each lens
category for each sensor [52].
The images from the ND Cosmetic Contact Lenses database [60]
were captured by two iris cameras, an LG4000 and an IrisGuard
AD100, in a controlled environment under NIR illumination with
a resolution of 480 × 640 pixels. These images are divided into
four classes, (i) no contact lenses, (ii) soft, (iii) non-textured and
(iv) textured contact lenses. Also, this database is organized into
two subsets: Subset1 (LG4000) and Subset2 (AD100). Subset1 has
3,000 images in the training set and 1,200 images in the validation
set. Subset2 contains 600 and 300 images for training and validation,
respectively [9, 53, 59]. Both subsets have 10 equal folds of training
images for testing purposes.
The ND Cross-Sensor-Iris-2013 database [62] is composed of
146,550 NIR images belonging to 676 unique subjects, being
29,986 images captured using an LG4000 and 116,564 taken by
an LG2200 iris sensor with 640 × 480 pixels of resolution. The
images were captured in 27 sessions over three years, from 2008
to 2010, and in at least two sessions there are images of the same
subject. The purpose of this database is to investigate the effect of
cross-sensor images on iris recognition. Initially, this database was
released for a competition to be held at the BTAS 2013 Conference,
but the competition did not have enough submission.
The Database of Iris Printouts was created for liveness detection
in iris images and contains 729 printout images of 243 eyes, and
1,274 images of imitations from genuine eyes. The database was
constructed as follows. First, the iris images were obtained with an
IrisGuard AD100 camera. Then, they were printed using the HP
LaserJet 1320 and Lexmark c534dn printers. To check the print

quality, the printed images were captured by the Panasonic ET-100
camera using an iris recognition software, and the images that were
successfully recognized were recaptured by an AD100 camera with
a resolution of 640 × 480 pixels to create the imitation subset. Ini-
tially, images from 426 distinct eyes belonging to 237 subjects were
collected. After the process of recognizing the printed images, 243
eyes images (which compose the database) were successfully veri-
ﬁed [48].
The IIITD Iris Spooﬁng (IIS) database was created to study
spooﬁng methods. To this end, printed images from the IIITD
CLI [52] database were used. Spooﬁng was simulated in two ways.
In the ﬁrst, the printed images were captured by a speciﬁc iris scan-
ner (Cogent CIS 202 dual eye), while in the second, the printed im-
ages were scanned using an HP ﬂatbed optical scanner. The database
contains 4,848 images from 101 individuals [49].
The Notre Dame Contact Lenses Dataset 2015 (NDCLD15)
database contains 7,300 iris images. The images were obtained un-
der consistent lighting conditions by an LG4000 and an IrisGuard
AD100 sensor. All images have 640 × 480 pixels of resolution and
are divided into three classes based on the lens type: no lens, soft,
and textured. This database was created to investigate methods to
classify iris images based on types of contact lenses [54].
The IIITD Combined Spooﬁng database was proposed to sim-
ulate a real-world scenario of attacks against iris recognition sys-
tems. This database consists of joining the following databases: II-
ITD CLI [52], IIITD IIS [49], SDB [45], IIT Delhi Iris [61] and, to
represent genuine classes, iris images from 547 subjects were col-
lected. The CSD database has a total of 1,872 subjects, with 9,325
normal image samples and 11,368 samples of impostor images [50].
The Gender from Iris (ND-GFI) database was created to study
the recognition of the subject’s gender through the iris, speciﬁcally
using the binary iris code (which is normally used in iris recognition
systems) [58]. The images were obtained at NIR wavelength by an
LG4000 sensor and labeled by gender. The ND-GFI database con-
tains a single image of each eye (left and right) from 750 men and
750 women, totaling 3,000 images. About a quarter of the images
were captured with the subjects wearing clear contact lenses. This
database has another set of images that can be used for validation,
called UND V, containing 1,944 images, being 3 images of each
eye from 175 men and 149 women. In this subset, there are also
images using clear contact lenses and some cosmetics [58].
According to [69], an iris image has good quality if the iris
diameter is larger than 200 pixels, and if the diameter is between
150 and 200 pixels, the image is classiﬁed as adequate quality. In
this context, the images from the BERC mobile-iris database have
irises with a diameter between 170 and 200 pixels, obtained at NIR
wavelength with 1280 × 960 pixels of resolution. Using a mobile
iris recognition system, the images were taken in sequences of 90
shots [63] moving the device at three distances: 15 to 25 cm, 25 to
15 cm, and 40 to 15 cm. In total, the database has 500 images from
100 subjects, which were the best ones selected by the authors of
each sequence.
The CASIA-Iris-Mobile-V1.0 database
is
composed of
11,000 NIR images belonging to 630 subjects, divided into three
subsets: CASIA-Iris-M1-S1 [70], CASIA-Iris-M1-S2 [71] and a
new one called CASIA-IRIS-M1-S3. The images were captured
simultaneously from the left and right eyes and stored in 8 bits
gray-level JPG ﬁles. The CASIA-Iris-M1-S1 subset has 1,400
images from 70 subjects with a resolution of 1080 × 1920 pixels,
acquired using a NIR imaging module attached to a mobile phone.
The CASIA-Iris-M1-S2 subset has images captured using a similar
device.
In total,
this subset contains 6,000 images from 200

5

subjects with a resolution of 1968 × 1024 pixels, collected at three
distances: 20, 25 and 30 cm. At last, the CASIA-Iris-M1-S3 subset
is composed of 3,600 images belonging to 360 subjects with a
resolution of 1920 × 1920 pixels, which were taken with a NIR
iris-scanning technology equipped on a mobile phone.
The Open Eye Dataset (OpenEDS) was created to investigate the
semantic segmentation of eyes components, and background [65].
This database is composed of 356,649 eye images, being 12,759
images with pixel-level annotations, 252,690 unlabeled ones, and
91,200 images from video sequences belonging from 152 subjects.
The images were captured with a head-mounted display with two
synchronized cameras under controlled NIR illumination with a res-
olution of 400 × 640 pixels.

2.2. Visible and Cross-Spectral Ocular Images Databases

Iris recognition using images taken at controlled NIR wavelength
environments is a mature technology, proving to be effective in dif-
ferent scenarios [3, 14–18]. Databases captured under controlled
environments have few or no noise factors in the images. However,
these conditions are not easy to achieve and require a high degree
of collaboration from subjects. In a more challenging/realistic sce-
nario, investigations on biometric recognition employing iris images
obtained in uncontrolled environments and at VIS wavelength have
begun to be conducted [27, 72]. There is also research on biometric
recognition using cross-spectral databases, i.e., databases with ocu-
lar images from the same individual obtained at both NIR and VIS
wavelengths [73–77]. Currently, many types of research have been
performed on biometric recognition using iris and periocular region
with images obtained from mobile devices, obtained in an uncon-
trolled environment and by different types of sensors [19, 78, 79].
In this subsection, we describe databases with these characteristics.
Table 3 summarize these databases. Some samples of ocular images
from VIS and Cross-spectral databases are shown in Figure 4.

Fig. 4. From top to bottom: VIS and Cross-spectral ocular image
samples from the VISOB [19], MICHE-I [78], UBIPr [20], CROSS-
EYED [40, 41] and PolyU Cross-Spectral [75] databases.

The UPOL (University of Palackeho and Olomouc) database has

6

high-quality iris images obtained at VIS wavelength using the opto-
metric framework (TOPCON TRC501A) and the Sony DXC-950P
3CCD camera. In total, 384 images of the left and right eyes were
obtained from 64 subjects at a distance of approximately 0.15 cm
with a resolution of 576 × 768 pixels, stored in 24 bits (RGB) [80].
The UBIRIS.v1 database [72] was created to provide images
with different types of noise, simulating image capture with minimal
collaboration from the users. This database has 1,877 images be-
longing to 241 subjects, obtained in two sections by a Nikon E5700
camera. For the ﬁrst section (enrollment), some noise factors such
as reﬂection, lighting, and contrast were minimized. However, in the
second section, natural lighting factors were introduced by changing
the location to simulate an image capture with minimal or without
active collaboration from the subjects. The database is available in
three formats: color with a resolution of 800 × 600 pixels, color with
200 × 150 pixels, and 200 × 150 pixels in grayscale [72].
The UTIRIS is one of the ﬁrst databases containing iris im-
ages captured at two different wavelengths (cross-spectral) [73]. The
database is composed of 1,540 images of the left and right eyes from
by a Canon EOS 10D camera with 2048 × 1360 pixels of resolu-
79 subjects, resulting in 158 classes. The VIS images were obtained
tion. To capture the NIR images, the ISW Lightwise LW camera
was used, obtaining iris images with a resolution of 1000 × 776 pix-
els. As the melanin pigment provides a rich source of features at
the VIS spectrum, which is not available at NIR, this database can
be used to investigate the impact of the fusion of iris image features
extracted at both wavelengths.
The UBIRIS.v2 database was built representing the most real-
istic noise factors. For this reason, the images that constitute the
database were obtained at VIS without restrictions such as distance,
angles, light, and movement. The main purpose of this database
is to provide a tool for the research on the use of VIS images for
iris recognition in an environment with adverse conditions. This
database contains images captured by a Canon EOS 5D camera, with
a resolution of 400 × 300 pixels, in RGB from 261 subjects contain-
ing 522 irises and 11,102 images taken in two sessions [27].
The UBIPr
(University
of Beira
Interior Periocular)
database [20] was created to investigate periocular recognition
using images taken under uncontrolled environments and setups.
The images from this database were captured by a Canon EOS 5D
camera with a 400mm focal length. Five different distances and
resolutions were conﬁgured: 501 × 401 pixels (8m), 561 × 541
pixels (7m), 651 × 501 pixels (6m), 801 × 651 pixels (5m), and
1001 × 801 pixels (4m). In total, the database has 10,950 images
from 261 subjects (the images from 104 subjects were obtained
in 2 sessions). Several variability factors were introduced in the
images, for example, different distances between the subject and
the camera, as well as different illumination, poses and occlusions
levels.
The BDCP (Biometrics Development Challenge Problem)
database [81] contains images from two different sensors:
an
LG4000 sensor that captures images in gray levels, and a Honey-
well Combined Face and Iris Recognition System (CFAIRS) cam-
era [81], which captures VIS images. The resolutions of the images
are 480 × 640 pixels for the LG4000 sensor and 600 × 750 pixels for
the CFAIRS camera. To compose the database, 2,577 images from
82 subjects were acquired by the CFAIRS sensor and 1,737 images
belonging to 99 subjects were taken by an LG4000 sensor. Images
of the same subject were obtained for both sensors [84]. The main
objective of this database is the cross-sensor evaluation, matching
NIR against VIS images [34]. It should be noted that this database
was used only in [84] and no availability information is reported.

Sequeira et al. [82] built the MobBIOfake database to investi-
gate iris liveliness detection using images taken from mobile devices
under an uncontrolled environment. It consists of 1,600 fake iris im-
ages obtained from a subset of the MobBIO database [85]. The fake
images were generated by printing the original images using a pro-
fessional printer in a high-quality photo paper and recapturing the
image with the same device and environmental conditions used in
the construction of MobBIO.
The images that compose the IIITD Multi-spectral Periocular
database were obtained under a controlled environment at NIR, VIS,
and night-vision spectra. The NIR images were captured by a Co-
gent iris Scanner sensor at a distance of 6 inches from the subject,
while the night vision subset was created using the Sony Handycam
camera in night vision mode at a distance of 1.3 meters. The VIS
images were captured with the Nikon SLR camera, also at a distance
of 1.3 meters. The database contains 1,240 images belonging to 62
subjects, being 310 images, 5 from each subject, at VIS and night
vision spectra, and 620 images, 10 from each subject, at NIR spec-
trum [74].
Nalla and Kumar [75] developed the PolyU Cross-Spectral
database to study iris recognition in the cross-spectral scenario. The
images were obtained simultaneously under VIS and NIR illumina-
tion, totaling 12,540 images from 209 subjects with 640×480 pixels
of resolution, being 15 images from each eye in each spectrum.
To evaluate the state of the art on iris recognition using images
acquired by mobile devices, the Mobile Iris Challenge Evaluation
(MICHE) competition (Part I) was created [78]. The MICHE-I (or
MICHEDB) database consists of 3,732 VIS images obtained by mo-
bile devices from 92 subjects. To simulate a real application, the iris
images were obtained by the users themselves, indoors and outdoors,
with and without glasses. Images of only one eye of each individ-
ual were captured. The mobile devices used and their respective
resolutions are iPhone5 (1536 × 2048), Galaxy S4 (2322 × 4128)
and Galaxy Tablet II (640 × 480). Due to the acquisition mode and
the purpose of the database, several noises are found in images such
as specular reﬂections, focus, motion blur, lighting variations, oc-
clusion due to eyelids, among others. The authors also proposed
a subset, called MICHE FAKE, containing 80 printed iris images.
Such images were created as follows. First, they were captured us-
ing the iPhone5 the Samsung Galaxy S4 mobile devices. Then, using
a LaserJet printer, the images were printed and captured again by a
Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone. There is still another subset, called

MICHE Video, containing videos of irises from 10 subjects obtained
indoor and outdoor. A Samsung Galaxy S4 and a Samsung Galaxy
Tab 2 mobile devices were used to capture these videos. In total, this
subset has 120 videos of approximately 15 seconds each.
The VSSIRIS database, proposed by Raja et al. [79], has a to-
tal of 560 images captured in a single session under an uncontrolled
environment from 28 subjects. The purpose of this database is to
investigate the mixed lighting effect (natural daylight and artiﬁcial
indoor) for iris recognition at the VIS spectrum with images ob-
tained by mobile devices [79]. More speciﬁcally, the images were
acquired by the rear camera of two smartphones: an iPhone 5S, with
a resolution of 3264 × 2448 pixels, and a Nokia Lumia 1020, with a
resolution of 7712 × 5360 pixels.
Santos et al. [83] created the CSIP (Cross-Sensor Iris and Pe-
riocular) database simulating mobile application scenarios. This
database has images captured by four different device models: Xpe-
ria Arc S (Sony Ericsson), iPhone 4 (Apple), w200 (THL) and
U8510 (Huawei). The resolutions of the images taken with these
devices are as follows: Xperia Arc S (Rear 3264 × 2448), iPhone 4
(Front 640 × 480, Rear 2592 × 1936), W200 (Front 2592 × 1936,
Rear 3264× 2448) and U8510 (Front 640× 480, Rear 2048× 1536).
Combining the models with front and rear cameras, as well as ﬂash,
10 different setups were created with the images obtained. In order
to simulate noise variation, the image capture sessions were carried
out in different sites with the following lighting conditions: artiﬁ-
cial, natural and mixed. Several noise factors are presented in these
images, such as different scales, off-angle, defocus, gaze, occlusion,
reﬂection, rotation and distortions [83]. The database has 2,004 im-
ages from 50 subjects and the binary iris segmentation masks were
obtained using the method described by Tan et al. [67] (winners of
the NICE I contest).
The VISOB database was created for the ICIP 2016 Competi-
tion on mobile ocular biometric recognition, whose main objective
was to evaluate methods for mobile ocular recognition using images
taken at the visible spectrum [19]. The front cameras of 3 mobile de-
vices were used to obtain the images: iPhone 5S at 720p resolution,
Samsung Note 4 at 1080p resolution and Oppo N1 at 1080p resolu-
tion. The images were captured in 2 sessions for each one of the 2
visits, which occurred between 2 and 4 weeks, counting in the total
158,136 images from 550 subjects. At each visit, it was required
that each volunteer (subject) capture their face using each one of the
three mobile devices at a distance between 8 and 12 inches from

7

the face. For each image capture session, 3 light conditions settings
were applied: regular ofﬁce light, dim light, and natural daylight.
The collected images were preprocessed using the Viola-Jones eye
detector and the region of the image containing the eyes was cropped
to a size of 240 × 160 pixels.
Sequeira
et
al.
[40,
41]
created
the Cross-Spectral
Iris/Periocular (CROSS-EYED) database to investigate iris and
periocular region recognition in cross-spectral scenarios. CROSS-
EYED is composed of VIS and NIR spectrum images obtained
simultaneously with 2K×2K pixel resolution cameras. The database
is organized into three subsets: ocular, periocular (without iris and
sclera regions) and iris. There are 3,840 images from 120 sub-
jects (240 classes), being 8 samples from each of the classes for
every spectrum. The periocular/ocular images have dimensions
of 900 × 800 pixels, while the iris images have dimensions of
400 × 300 pixels. All images were obtained at a distance of
1.5 meters, under uncontrolled indoor environment, with a wide
variation of ethnicity and eye colors, and lightning reﬂexes.
The QUT Multispectral Periocular database was developed and
used by Algashaam et al. [76] to study multi-spectral periocular
recognition. In total, 212 images belonging to 53 subjects were cap-
tured at VIS, NIR and night vision spectrum with 800× 600 pixels of
resolution. The VIS and NIR images were taken using a Sony DCR-
DVD653E camera, while the night vision images were acquired with
an IP2M-842B camera.

2.3. Multimodal Databases

In addition to the databases proposed speciﬁcally to assist the de-
velopment and evaluation of new methodologies for iris/periocular
recognition, some multimodal databases can also be used for this
purpose. Table 4 show these databases. As described in this subsec-
tion, most of these databases consist of iris images obtained at NIR
wavelength. Figure 5 shows samples of ocular images from some
multimodal databases.

Fig. 5. From top to bottom: ocular image samples from the Mob-
BIO [85], SDUMLA-HMT [86] and CASIA-IrisV4-Distance [28]
multimodal databases.

The BioSec baseline database, proposed by Fierrez et al. [68],
has biometric data of ﬁngerprint, face, iris and voice. Data were
acquired from 200 subjects in two acquisition sessions, with envi-
ronmental conditions (e.g., lighting and background noise) not be-
ing controlled to simulate a real situation. There are 3,200 NIR iris
images, being 4 images of each eye for each session, captured by an
LG IrisAccess EOU3000 camera [68].
The BiosecurID multimodal database consists of 8 unimodal
biometric traits:
iris, face, speech, signature, ﬁngerprints, hand,
handwriting, and keystroking [87]. The authors collected data from

8

400 subjects in four acquisition sessions through 4 months at six
Spanish institutions. The iris images were captured at NIR by an
LG Iris Access EOU 3000 camera with a resolution of 640 × 480
pixels. Four images of each eye were obtained in each of the 4 ses-
sions, totaling 32 images per individual and a ﬁnal set of 12,800 iris
images.
The BMDB (multienvironment multiscale BioSecure Multi-
modal Database) [88] has biometric data from more than 600 sub-
jects, obtained from 11 European institutions participating in the
BioSecure Network of Excellence [88]. This database contains bio-
metric data of iris, face, speech, signature, ﬁngerprint and hand, and
is organized into three subsets: DS1, which has data collected from
the Internet under unsupervised conditions; DS2, with data obtained
in an ofﬁce environment under supervision; and DS3, in which mo-
bile hardware was used to take data indoor and outdoor. The iris
images belong to the DS2 subset and were obtained in 2 sessions
at NIR wavelength in an indoor environment with supervision. For
the acquisition, the use of contact lenses was accepted, but glasses
needed to be removed. Four images (2 of each eye) were obtained
in each session for each of the 667 subjects, totaling 5,336 images.
These images have a resolution of 640 × 480 pixels and were ac-
quired by an LG Iris Access EOU3000 sensor.
The goal of
the Multiple Biometrics Grand Challenge
(MBGC) [89] was the evaluation of iris and face recognition meth-
ods using data obtained from still images and videos under uncon-
strained conditions [2]. The MBGC is divided into three problems:
the portal challenge problem, the still face challenge problem, and
the video challenge problem [89]. This competition has two ver-
sions. The ﬁrst one was held to introduce the problems and protocol,
whereas version 2 was released to evaluate the approaches in large
datasets [2]. The iris images were obtained from videos captured at
NIR by an Iridian LG EOU 2200 camera [93]. The videos present
variations such as pose, illumination, and camera angle. The MBGC
database has 986 iris videos from 268 eyes collected in 2008 [93].
The Q-FIRE database (Quality in Face and Iris Research En-
semble) has iris and face images from 195 subjects, obtained through
videos at different distances [90]. This database has 28 and 27 videos
of face and iris, respectively, captured in 2 sections, with varying
camera distance between 5, 7, 11, 15 and 25 feet. The videos have
approximately 6 seconds each and were captured at approximately
25 frames per second. A Dalsa 4M30 infrared camera equipped with
a Tamron AF 70-300mm 1:4.5-5.6 LD DI lens were used to capture
iris videos. For distances of 15 and 25 feet, a Sigma APO 300-
800mm F5.6 EX DG HSM lens was used. The most attractive dis-
tance of capture for iris is 5 (280 × 300 pixels), 7 (200 × 220 pixels),
and 11 (100× 120 pixels) feet since they respectively represent high,
medium and low resolution, based on the number of pixels in the iris
diameter. The images also have variations of illumination, defocus,
blur, eye angles, motion blur, and occlusions [90].
The NIR images from the ocular region (iris and periocu-
lar) of the FOCS database [91] were extracted from the MBGC
database [89] videos, which were collected from moving sub-
jects [94]. These videos were captured in an uncontrolled environ-
ment presenting some variations such as noise, gaze, occlusion and
lighting. The database has 9,581 images (4,792 left, 4,789 right)
with a resolution of 600 × 750 pixels from 136 subjects [84].
Their system can recognize users from up to 3 meters (10 feet)
using a system with an active search for iris, face or palmprint pat-
terns. The images were taken using a camera with high resolution
so that a single image includes regions of interest for both eyes
and face traits. Information from the face trait such as skin pattern
can also be used for multi-modal fusion. The database has 2,567

images from 142 individuals and 284 classes with a resolution of
2352 × 1728 pixels.
The SDUMLA-HMT multimodal database contains biometric
traits of iris, face, ﬁnger vein, gait, and ﬁngerprint [86]. All data
belong to 106 subjects and were collected at Shandong University in
China. The iris images were collected at NIR and under a controlled
environment at a distance of 6 cm to 32 cm between the camera
and the subject. In total, the authors collected 1,060 iris images with
768 × 576 pixels of resolution, being 10 images (5 of each eye) from
each subject [86].
Sequeira et al. [85] created the MobBIO database due to the
growing interest in mobile biometric applications, as well as the
growing interest and application of multimodal biometrics. This
database has data from iris, face, and voice belonging to 105 sub-
jects. The data were obtained using an Asus TPad TF 300T mobile
device, and the images were captured using the rear camera of this
device in 8 MP of resolution. The iris images were obtained at VIS
and in two different illumination conditions varying eye orientations
and occlusion levels. For each subject, 16 images (8 of each eye,
cropped from an image of both eyes) were captured. The cropped
images have a resolution of 300 × 200 pixels. Manual annotations
of the iris and pupil contours are provided along with the database,
but iris illumination noises are not identiﬁed.
The gb2sµMOD database is composed of 8,160 iris, face and
hand videos belonging to 60 subjects and captured in three sessions
with environment condition variation [92]. Sessions 1 and 2 were
obtained in a controlled environment, while session 3 was acquired
in an uncontrolled environment. The iris videos were recorded only
in sessions 1 and 2 with a NIR camera (850 nm) held by the subject
himself as close to the face as possible capturing both eyes. The
diameter of the iris in such videos is approximately 60 pixels. Ten
iris videos were collected in two (5 in each session) for each one of
the 60 subjects. Along with the videos, information such as name,
ID card number, age, gender, and handedness are also available.
All databases described in this subsection contain iris and/or pe-
riocular subsets, however, some databases that do not have such sub-
sets can also be employed for iris/periocular recognition. For exam-
ple, the FRGC [95] database, which is a database of face images, has
already been used for iris [24] and periocular [37, 84, 96] recognition
in the literature.

biometrics and also the current challenges in this research area.
The competitions usually provide a database in which the com-
petitors must perform their experiments and submit their algorithms.
Once submitted, the algorithms are evaluated with another subset of
the database, according to the metrics established by the competition
protocol. In this way, it is possible to fairly assess the performance
of different methodologies for speciﬁc objectives.
In ocular biometrics including iris and periocular recognition,
there are several competitions aimed at evaluating different situa-
tions, such as recognition in images captured at NIR and/or VIS
wavelengths, images captured in an uncontrolled environment, im-
ages obtained with mobile devices, among others. For each com-
petition, we describe the approaches that achieved the best results
using fused information from iris and periocular region, and also the
best performing methodologies using only iris information. Table 5
presents the main competitions held in recent years and the best re-
sults achieved, while Table 6 details the methodologies that obtained
the best results in these competitions.

3.1. NICE - Noisy Iris Challenge Evaluation

The Noisy Iris Challenge Evaluation (NICE) competition contains
two different contests. In the ﬁrst one (NICE.I), held in 2008, the
goal was the evaluation of methods for iris segmentation to remove
noise factors such as specular reﬂections and occlusions. Regard-
ing the evaluation of encoding and matching methods, the second
competition (NICE.II), was carried out in 2010. The databases used
in both competitions are subsets of UBIRIS.v2 [27], which con-
tains VIS ocular images captured under uncontrolled environments.
Described by Proenc¸ a and Alexandre [18], the ﬁrst competition
aimed to answer: “is it possible to automatically segment a small tar-
get as the iris in unconstrained data (obtained in a non-cooperative
environment)?” In total, 97 research laboratories from 22 countries
participate in the competition. The training set consisted of 500
images, and their respective manually generated binary iris masks.
The committee evaluated the proposed approaches using another
500 images through a pixel-to-pixel comparison between the orig-
inal and the generated segmentation masks. As a metric, the orga-
nizers choose the following error rate based on pixel-level:

n(cid:88)

h(cid:88)

According to the values of Ej , NICE.I’s best results are the fol-
lowing: 0.0131 [67], 0.0162 [101], 0.0180 [102], 0.0224 [103],
0.0282 [104], 0.0297 [105], 0.0301 [106], 0.0305 [107].
The second competition (NICE.II) evaluated only the feature ex-
traction and matching results. Therefore, all the participants used
the same segmented images, which were generated by the winner
methodology in the NICE.I contest [18], proposed by Tan et al. [67].
The main goal was to investigate the impact of noise presented in-
side the iris region in the biometric recognition process. As de-
scribed in both competitions [18], these noise factors have different
sources, e.g., specular reﬂection and occlusion, caused by the un-
controlled environment where the images were taken. This compe-
tition received algorithms sent by 67 participants from 30 countries.
The training set consists of 1,000 images and their respective binary
masks. The proposed methods had to receive a pair of images fol-
lowed by their masks as input and generate an output ﬁle containing
the dissimilarity scores (d) of which pairwise comparison with the
following conditions:

1. d(I , I ) = 0
2. d(I1 , I2 ) = 0 ⇒ I1 = I2
3. d(I1 , I2 ) + d(I2 , I3 ) ≥ d(I1 , I3 ).

The submitted approaches were evaluated using a new set of
1,000 images with their binary masks. Consider IM = {I1 , ..., In }
as a collection of iris images, M A = {M1 , ..., Mn } as their re-
spective masks, and id(.) representing a function that identiﬁes an
image. The comparison protocol one-against-all returns a match set
1 , ..., dim } and a non-match set DE = de
dissimilarity scores, where id(Ii ) = id(Ij ) and id(Ii ) (cid:54)= id(Ij ),
respectively. The algorithms were evaluated using the decidability
scores d(cid:48) [44], which measure the separation level of two distribu-
tions. The following overlap area gives this decidability scores d(cid:48) :

1 , ..., dek } of

DI = {di

|µE − µI |
2 (σ2
I + σ2
E )

,

where the means of the two distributions are given by µI and µE ,
and the standard deviations are represented by σI and σI .
The best results of NICE.II ranked by their d(cid:48) scores are as
follows: 2.5748 [23], 1.8213 [97], 1.7786 [108], 1.6398 [109],
1.4758 [110], 1.2565 [111], 1.1892 [112], 1.0931 [113].
The winner method, proposed by Tan et al. [23], achieved a
decidability value of 2.5748 by fusing iris and periocular features.
The fusion process was performed at the score level by the sum rule
method. Therefore, for iris and periocular images, different features
and matching techniques were used. The iris features were extracted
with ordinal measures and color histogram and for the periocular
ones, texton histogram, and semantic information. To compute the
matching scores, the authors employed the following metrics: SO-
Boost learning, diffusion distance, chi-square distance, and exclu-
sive OR operator.
Wang et al. [97] proposed a method using only iris information.
Their approach was ranked second in the competition, achieving a
decidability value of 1.8213. The algorithm performed the segmen-
tation and normalization of iris using the Daugman technique [114].
Features were extracted by applying the Gabor ﬁlters from differ-
ent patches generated from the normalized image. The AdaBoost
algorithm computed a selection of features and the similarity.
The main contribution of NICE competitions was the evaluation
of iris segmentation and recognition methods independently, as sev-
eral iris segmentation methodologies were evaluated in the ﬁrst com-
petition and the best one was applied to generate the binary masks
used in the second one, in which the recognition task was evalu-
ated. Hence, the approaches described in both competitions can be

10

fairly compared since they employed the same images for training
and testing.
Although NICE.II was intended to evaluate iris recognition sys-
tems, some approaches using information from the periocular re-
gion were also included in the ﬁnal ranking. The winning method
fused iris and periocular information, however, it should be noted
that some approaches that also fused these two traits achieved lower
results than methodologies that used only iris features. Moreover, it
would be interesting to analyze the best performing approaches in
the NICE.II competition in larger databases to verify the scalability
of the proposed methodologies, as the database used in these com-
petitions was not composed of a large number of images/classes.
Some recent works applying deep Convolutional Neural Net-
work (CNN) models have achieved state-of-the-art results in the
NICE.II database using information from the iris [115], periocular
region [22] and fusing iris/periocular traits [116] with decidability
values of 2.25, 3.47, 3.45, respectively.

3.2. MICHE - Mobile Iris Challenge Evaluation

In order to assess the performance that can be reached in iris recogni-
tion without the use of special equipment, the Mobile Iris CHallenge
Evaluation II, or simply MICHE-II competition, was held [39]. The
MICHE-I database, introduced by De Marsico et al. [78] has 3,732
images taken by mobile devices and was made available to the par-
ticipants to train their algorithms, while other images obtained in the
same way were employed for the evaluation.
Similarly to NICE.I and NICE.II, MICHE is also divided into
two phases. MICHE.I and MICHE.II focused on iris segmentation
and recognition, respectively. Ensuring a fair assessment and target-
ing only the recognition step, all MICHE.II participants used the seg-
mentation algorithm proposed by Haindl and Krupicka [117], which
achieved the best performance on MICHE.I.
The performance of each algorithm was evaluated through dis-
similarity. Assuming I as a set of the MICHE.II database and that
Ia , Ib ∈ I , the dissimilarity function D is deﬁned by:

D(Ia , Ib ) ⇒ [0, 1] ⊂ R ,

(3)

satisfying the following properties:

1. D(Ia , Ia ) = 0
2. D(Ia , Ib ) = 0 ⇒ Ia = Ib
3. D(Ia , Ib ) = D(Ib , Ia ).

Two metrics were employed to assess the algorithms. The ﬁrst,
called Recognition Rate (RR), was used to evaluate the performance
in the identiﬁcation problem (1:n), while the second, called Area
Under the Curve (AUC), was applied to evaluate the performance in
the veriﬁcation problem (1:1). In addition, the methodologies were
evaluated in two different setups: ﬁrst comparing only images ac-
quired by the same device and then using images obtained by two
different devices (cross-sensor). The algorithms were ranked by the
average performance of RR and AUC. The best results are listed in
Table 7.
Ahmed et al. [25, 26] proposed the algorithm that achieved the
best result. Their methodology performs the matching of the iris and
the periocular region separately and combines the ﬁnal score values
of each approach. For the iris, they used the rubber sheet model nor-
malization proposed by Daugman [114]. Then, the iris codes were
generated from the normalized images with the 1-D Log-Gabor ﬁl-
ter. The matching was computed with the Hamming distance. Us-
ing only iris information, an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 2.12% was

reached. Features from the periocular region were extracted with
Multi-Block Transitional Local Binary Patterns and the matching
was computed with the chi-square distance. With features from the
periocular region, an EER of 2.74% was reported. The outputs of
both modalities (iris and periocular) were normalized with z-score
and combined with weighted scores. The weights used for the fu-
sion were 0.55 for the iris and 0.45 for the periocular region, yield-
ing an EER of 1.22% and an average between RR and AUC of 1.00.
The best performing approach using only iris information was
proposed by Raja et al. [98]. In their method, the iris region was ﬁrst
located through a segmentation method proposed by Raja et al. [79]
and then normalized using the rubber sheet expansion model [44].
Each image band (red, green and blue) was divided into several
blocks. The features were extracted from these blocks, as well as
from the entire image, using a set of deep sparse ﬁlters, resulting in
deep sparse histograms. The histograms of each block and each band
were concatenated with the histogram of the entire image, forming
the vector of iris features. The features extracted were used to learn
a collaborative subspace, which was employed for matching. This
algorithm achieved the third place in the competition, with an aver-
age between RR and AUC of 0.86 and with EER values of 0% in the
images obtained by the iPhone 5S and 6.55% in the images obtained
by Samsung S4.
This competition was the ﬁrst to evaluate iris recognition using
images captured by mobile devices and also to evaluate methodolo-
gies applied to the cross-sensor problem, i.e., to recognize images
acquired by different sensors.
As in the NICE.II competition, one issue is the scalability evalu-
ation of the evaluated approaches. Although the reported results are
very promising, we have to consider them as preliminary since the
test set used for the assessment is very small, containing only 120
images. As expected, the best results were attained using iris and
periocular region information, however, some approaches that used
only iris information achieved better results than others that fused
iris and periocular region information.

3.3. MIR - Competition on Mobile Iris Recognition

The BTAS Competition on Mobile Iris Recognition (MIR2016) was
proposed to raise the state of the art of iris recognition algorithms
on mobile devices under NIR illumination [99]. Five algorithms,
submitted by two participants, were eligible for the evaluation.
A database (MIR-Train) was made available for training the al-
gorithms and a second database (MIR-Test) was used for the evalua-
tion. Both databases were collected under NIR illumination. The im-
ages of the two irises were collected simultaneously under an indoor
environment. Three sets of images were obtained, with distances of
20 cm, 25 cm, and 30 cm, and 10 images for each distance. The
images from both databases were collected in the same session. The
MIR-Train database is composed of 4,500 images from 150 sub-

11

jects, while MIR-Test has 12,000 images from 400 subjects. All
images are grayscale with a resolution of 1968 × 1024 pixels. The
main sources of intra-class variation in the images are due to vari-
ations in lighting, eyeglasses and specular reﬂections, defocus, dis-
tance changes, and others. Differently from NICE.II, the segmenta-
tion masks were not provided in MIR2016, thus, the methodologies
submitted included iris detection, segmentation, feature extraction,
and matching.

For the evaluation, the organizing committee considered that the
left and right irises belong to the same class; thus, a fusion of the
matching scores of both irises was performed. All possible intra-
class comparisons (i.e., irises from the same subjects) were imple-
mented to compute the False Non-Match Rate (FNMR). From each
iris class, two samples were randomly selected to calculate the False
Match Rate (FMR). In total, 174,000 intra-class and 319,200 inter-
class matches were used. In cases where intra- or inter-class com-
parisons could not be performed due to failure enrollment or fail-
ure match, a random value between 0 and 1 was assigned to the
score. The classiﬁcation of the participants was performed using the
FNMR4 metric, but the EER and DI metrics were also reported. The
FNMR4 metric reports the FNMR value when the FMR equals to
0.0001. The EER is the value when FNMR is equal to the FMR, and
the DI value is the decidability index, as explained previously.

The best result was from the Beijing Bata Technology Co. Ltd.
reporting FNMR4 = 2.24%, EER = 1.41% and DI = 3.33. The
methodology, described in [99], includes four steps: iris detection,
preprocessing, feature extraction, and matching. For iris detection,
the face is found using the AdaBoost algorithm [128] and eye po-
sitions are found by using Support Vector Machines (SVM). Next,
to lessen the effect of light reﬂections, the irises and pupils are de-
tected by the modiﬁed Daugmans Integro-Differential operator [44].
In pre-processing, reﬂection regions are located and then removed
using a threshold and shape information. Afterward, the iris re-
gion is normalized using the method proposed by Daugman [114].
Eyelashes are also detected and removed using a threshold. An im-
provement in image quality is achieved through histogram equaliza-
tion. The features were extracted with Gabor wavelet, while Prin-
cipal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analy-
sis (LDA) were applied for dimensionality reduction. The matching
was performed using the cosine and Hamming distances, and the
results combined.

The second place was achieved by TigerIT Bangladesh Ltd. with
FNMR4 = 7.07%, EER = 1.29% and DI = 3.94. The proposed ap-
proach also made improvements in image quality through histogram
equalization and smoothing. After pre-processing, the iris was nor-
malized using the rubber sheet model [129]. Features were then ex-
tracted with 2D Gabor wavelets, while the matching was performed
employing the Hamming distance. This methodology was classiﬁed
in second place since it obtained a higher FNMR4 value than the ﬁrst
one, but the EER and DI values were better than those reported by
the winning algorithm of the competition.

The MIR2016’s main contribution is to be the ﬁrst competition
using NIR images acquired by mobile modules, in addition to the
construction of a new database containing images from both eyes of
each individual. Unfortunately, the competition did not have many
participants and the proposed methodologies consist only of classical
literature techniques.

3.4. ICIP - Competition on Mobile Ocular Biometric Recogni-
tion

The VISOB database was created for the ICIP 2016 Competition on
mobile ocular biometric recognition, whose main objective was to
evaluate the progress of research in the area of mobile ocular bio-
metrics at the visible spectrum [19]. The front cameras of 3 mobile
devices were used to obtain the images: iPhone 5S at 720p resolu-
tion, Samsung Note 4 at 1080p resolution and Oppo N1 at 1080p
resolution. The images were captured in 2 sessions for each one
of the 2 visits, which occurred between 2 and 4 weeks, counting in
the total 158,136 images from 550 subjects. At each visit, it was
required that each volunteer (subject) capture their own face using
each one of the three mobile devices at a distance between 8 and 12
inches from the face. For each session, images were captured un-
der 3 light conditions: regular ofﬁce light, ofﬁces lights off but dim
ambient lighting still present (dim light) and next to sunlit windows
(natural daylight settings). The collected database was preprocessed
using the Viola-Jones eye detector and the region of the image con-
taining the eyes was crop to a size of 240 × 160 pixels.
The ICIP competition was designed to evaluate ocular biometric
recognition methodologies using images obtained from mobile de-
vices in visible light on a large-scale database. The database created
and used for the competition was VISOB (VISOB Dataset ICIP2016
Challenge Version) [19]. This database has 158,136 images from
550 subjects, and is the database of images obtained from mobile
devices with the largest number of subjects. The images were cap-
tured by 3 different devices (iPhone 5S, Oppo N1 and Samsung Note
4) under 3 different lighting classes: ‘daylight’, ‘ofﬁce’, and ‘dim
light’. Four different research groups participated in the competi-
tion and 5 algorithms were submitted. The metric used to assess the
performance of the algorithms was EER.
In almost all competitions, participants submit an algorithm al-
ready trained and the evaluation is performed on an unknown portion
of the database. On the other hand, ICIP competitors submitted an
algorithm that was trained and tested on an unknown portion of the
database. Two different evaluations were carried out. In the ﬁrst one
(see Table 8), the algorithms were trained (enrollment) and tested for
each device and type of illumination.

To assess the effect of illumination on ocular recognition, the tests
were performed with the 3 types of illumination for each device. The
results are shown in Table 9.

Raghavendra and Busch [100] achieved an EER between 0.06%
and 0.20% in all assessments, obtaining the best result of the com-
petition. The proposed approach extracted periocular features using
Maximum Response (MR) ﬁlters from a bank containing 38 ﬁlters,
and a deep neural network learned with a regularized stacked au-
toencoders [100]. For noise removal, the authors applied a Gaus-
sian ﬁlter and performed histogram equalization and image resizing.
Finally, the classiﬁcation was performed through a deep neural net-
work based on deeply coupled autoencoders.
All participants explored features based on the texture of the eye
images, extracted from the periocular region. None of the submit-
ted algorithms extracted features only from the iris. The organiz-
ing committee compared the performance of the algorithms using
images obtained only by the same devices, that is, the algorithms
were not trained and tested on images from different devices (cross-
sensor). Thus, the main contributions of this competition were a
large database containing images from different sensors and envi-
ronments, along with the assessments on these different setups.

3.5. Cross-Eyed - Cross-Spectral Iris/Periocular Competition

The ﬁrst Cross-Eyed competition was held in 2016 at the 8th IEEE
International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications, and
Systems (BTAS). The aim of the competition was the evaluation of
iris and periocular recognition algorithms using images captured at
different wavelengths. The CROSS-EYED database [40, 41], em-
ployed in the competition, has iris and periocular images obtained
simultaneously at the VIS and NIR wavelengths.
Iris and periocular recognition were evaluated separately. To
avoid the use of iris information in the periocular evaluation, a mask
excluding the entire iris region was applied. Six algorithms sub-
mitted by 2 participants, named HH from Halmstad University and
NTNU from Norway Biometrics Laboratory, qualiﬁed. The ﬁnal
evaluation was carried out with another set of images, containing

13

632 images from 80 subjects for periocular recognition and 1,280
images from 160 subjects for iris recognition.
The evaluation consisted of enrollment and template match-
ing of intra-class (all NIR against all VIS images) and inter-class
comparisons (3 NIR against 3 VIS images – per class). A met-
ric based on Generalized False Accept Rate (GFAR) and General-
ized False Reject Rate (GFFR) was used to verify the performance
of the submitted algorithms. These metrics generalize the FMR
and the FNMR, including Failure-to-enroll (FTE) and Failure-to-
acquire (FTA). Finally, to compare the algorithms, the GF2 metric
(GFRR@GFAR = 0.01) was employed.
Halmstad University (HH) team submitted 3 algorithms. The
approaches consist of fusing features extracted with Symmetry Pat-
terns (SAFE), Gabor Spectral Decomposition (GABOR), Scale-
Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Local Binary Patterns (LBP)
and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). These fusions were
evaluated combining scores from images obtained by the same sen-
sors and also by different sensors. The evaluated algorithms dif-
fer by the fusion of different features: HH1 fusing all the features;
HH2 fusing SAFE, GABOR, LBP and HOG; and HH3 fusing GA-
BOR, LBP and HOG. The algorithms were applied only to perioc-
ular recognition, and the best performance was achieved by HH1 ,
which achieved an EER of 0.29% and GF2 of 0.00%. More details
can be found in [40].
The Norwegian Biometrics Laboratory (NTNU) also submitted
3 algorithms, which applied the same approaches for feature extrac-
tion from iris and periocular traits. The iris region was located using
a technique based on the approach proposed by Raja et. al. [79], and
features were extracted through histograms resulting from the multi-
scale BSIF, a bank of independent binarized statistical ﬁlters. These
histograms were compared using the Chi-Square distance metric.
Lastly, an SVM was employed to obtain the fusion and scores corre-
sponding to each ﬁlter. The best approach achieved EER of 4.84%
and GF2 of 14.43% in periocular matching, and EER of 2.78% and
GF2 of 3.31% in iris matching.
In 2017, the second edition of this competition was held [41].
Similarly to the ﬁrst competition, the submitted approaches were
ranked by EER and GF2 values. Comparisons in periocular images
were made separately for each eye, i. e., the left eyes were com-
pared only with left eyes, and the same for the right eyes. The main
difference was in the database used, as the training set consisted of
the CROSS-EYED database and the test set was made with 55 sub-
jects. As in the ﬁrst competition, the matching protocol consisted
of intra- and inter-class comparisons, in which all intra-class com-
parisons were performed and only 3 random images per class were
applied in the inter-class comparisons. Results and methodologies
of 4 participants were reported, being 4 participants with 11 algo-
rithms for periocular recognition, and 1 participant with 4 algorithms
for iris recognition. Two of these participants took part in the ﬁrst
competition, Halmstad University (HH) and Norwegian Biometrics
Laboratory (NTNU). The other three competitors were IDIAP from
Switzerland, IIT Indore from India, and an anonymous.
The best method using periocular information was submitted by
HH1 , which fused features based on SAFE, GABOR, SIFT, LBP
and HOG. Their approach, similar to the one proposed in the ﬁrst
competition, reached EER and GF2 values of 0.82% and 0.74%, re-
spectively. For iris recognition, the best results were attained by
N T N U4 , which was based on BSIF features and reported EER and
GF2 values of 0.05% and 0.00%, respectively.
We point out two main contributions of these competitions:
(i) the release of a new cross-spectral database, and (ii) the evalu-
ation of several approaches using iris and periocular traits with some

promising strategies that can be applied for cross-spectral ocular
recognition. Nevertheless, we also highlight some problems in their
evaluation protocols. First, the periocular evaluation in the second
competition only matches left eyes against left eyes and right eyes
against right eyes using prior knowledge of the database. Another
problem is the comparison protocol, which uses only 3 images per
class in inter-class comparisons instead of all images without specif-
ically reporting which ones were used. There is also no information
on code availability, and details of the methodologies are lacking,
limiting the reproducibility.

4. DEEP LEARNING IN OCULAR RECOGNITION

Recently, deep learning approaches have won many machine learn-
ing competitions, even achieving superhuman visual results in some
domains [131]. Therefore, in this section, we describe recent works
that applied deep learning-based techniques to ocular recognition.
Liu et al. [132] presented one of the ﬁrst works applying deep
learning to iris recognition. Their approach, called DeepIris, was
created for recognizing heterogeneous irises captured by different
sensors. The proposed method was based on a CNN model with a
bank of pairwise ﬁlters, which learns the similarity between a pair of
images. The evaluation in veriﬁcation protocol was carried out in the
Q-FIRE and CASIA cross-sensor databases and reported promising
results with EER of 0.15% and 0.31%, respectively.
Gangwar and Joshi [133] also developed a deep learning method
for iris veriﬁcation on the cross-sensor scenario, called DeepIrisNet.
They presented two CNN architectures for extracting iris representa-
tions and evaluated them using images from the ND-IRIS-0405 and
ND Cross-Sensor-Iris-2013 databases. The ﬁrst model was com-
posed of 8 standard convolutional, 8 normalization, and 2 dropout
layers. The second one, on the other hand, has inception layers [134]
and consists of 5 convolutional layers, 7 normalization layers, 2 in-
ception layers, and 2 dropout layers. Compared to the baselines,
their methodology reported better robustness on different factors
such as the quality of segmentation, rotation, and input, training,
and network sizes.
To demonstrate that generic descriptors can generate discrimi-
nant iris features, Nguyen et al. [135] applied distinct deep learn-
ing architectures to NIR databases obtained in controlled environ-
ments. They evaluated the following CNN models pre-trained using
images from the ImageNet database [136]: AlexNet, VGG, Incep-
tion, ResNet and DenseNet. Iris representations were extracted from
normalized images at different depths of each CNN architecture,
and a multi-class SVM classiﬁer was employed for the identiﬁcation
task. Although no ﬁne-tuning process was performed, interesting
results were reported in the LG2200 (ND Cross-Sensor-Iris-2013)
and CASIA-IrisV4-Thousand databases. In their experiments, the
representations extracted from intermediate layers of the networks
reported better results than the representations from deeper layers.
The method proposed by Al-Waisy et al. [137] used left and
right irises information for the identiﬁcation task. In this approach,
each iris was ﬁrst detected and normalized, and then features were
extracted and matched. Finally, the left and right irises matching
scores were fused. Several CNN conﬁgurations and architectures
were evaluated during the training phase and, based on a valida-
tion set, the best one was chosen. The authors also evaluated other
training strategies such as dropout and data augmentation. Experi-
ments carried out on three databases (i.e., SDUMLA-HMT, CASIA-
IrisV3-Interval, and IIT Delhi Iris) reported a 100% rank-1 recogni-
tion rate in all of them.

Generally, an iris recognition system has several preprocessing
steps, including segmentation and normalization (using Daugman’s
approach [114]). In this context, Zanlorensi et al. [115] analyzed
the impact of these steps when extracting deep representations from
iris images. Applying deep representations extracted from an iris
bounding box without both segmentation and normalization pro-
cesses, they reported better results compared to those obtained using
normalized and segmented images. The authors also ﬁne-tuned two
pre-trained models for face recognition (i.e., VGG-16 and ResNet50)
and proposed a data augmentation technique by rotating the iris
bounding boxes. In their experiments, using only iris information,
an EER of 13.98% (i.e., state-of-the-art results) was reached in the
NICE.II database.
As the performance of many iris recognition systems is related
to the quality of detection and segmentation of the iris, Proenc¸ a and
Neves [16] proposed a robust method for inaccurately segmented
images. Their approach consisted of corresponding iris patches
between pairs of images, which estimates the probability that two
patches belong to the same biological region. According to the
authors, the comparison of these patches can also be performed
in cases of bad segmentation and non-linear deformations caused
by pupil constriction/dilation. The following databases were used
in the experiments: CASIA-IrisV3-Lamp, CASIA-IrisV4-Lamp,
CASIA-IrisV4-Thousand, and WVU. The authors reported results
using good quality data as well as data with severe segmentation
errors. Using accurately segmented data, they achieved EER val-
ues of 0.6% (CASIA-IrisV3-Lamp), 2.6% (CASIA-IrisV4-Lamp),
3.0% (CASIA-IrisV4-Thousand) and 4.2% (WVU).
The methodology proposed in [17] does not require preprocess-
ing steps, such as iris segmentation and normalization, for iris ver-
iﬁcation. In this approach, which is based on deep learning mod-
els, the authors used biologically corresponding patches to discrimi-
nate genuine and impostor comparisons in pairs of iris images, sim-
ilarly to IRINA [16]. These patches were learned in the normal-
ized iris images and then remapped into a polar coordinate sys-
tem. In this way, only a detected/cropped iris bounding box is re-
quired in the matching stage. State-of-the-art results were reported
in three NIR databases, achieving EER values of 0.6%, 3.0%, and
6.3% in the CASIA-Iris-V4-Lamp, CASIA-IrisV4-Thousand, and
WVU, respectively.
In [77], Wang and Kumar claimed that iris features extracted
from CNN models are generally sparse and can be used for tem-
plate compression. In the cross-spectral scenario, the authors evalu-
ated several hashing algorithms to reduce the size of iris templates,
reporting that the supervised discrete hashing was the most effec-
tive in terms of size and matching. Features were extracted from
normalized iris images with some deep learning architectures, e.g.,
CNN with softmax cross-entropy loss, siamese network, and triplet
network. Promising results were reported by incorporating super-
vised discrete hashing on the deep representations extracted with a
CNN model trained with a softmax cross-entropy loss. The pro-
posed methodology was evaluated on a cross-spectral scenario and
achieved EER values of 12.41% and 6.34% on the PolyU Cross-
Spectral and CROSS-EYED databases, respectively.
Zanlorensi et al. [138] performed extensive experiments in the
cross-spectral scenario applying two CNN models: ResNet-50 [139]
and VGG16 [140]. Both models were ﬁrst pre-trained for face recog-
nition and then ﬁne-tuned using periocular and iris images. The
results of the experiments, carried out in two databases: CROSS-
EYED and PolyU Cross-Spectral, indicated that it is possible to ap-
ply a single CNN model to extract discriminant features from im-
ages captured at both NIR and VIS wavelengths. The authors also

14

evaluate the impact of representation extraction at different depths
from the ResNet-50 model and the use of different weights for fusing
iris and periocular features. For the veriﬁcation task, their approach
achieved state-of-the-art results in both databases on intra- and cross-
spectral scenarios using iris, periocular, and fused features.
Luz et al. [22] designed a biometric system for the periocu-
lar region employing the VGG-16 model [140]. Promising results
were reported by performing transfer learning from the face recog-
nition domain and ﬁne-tuning the system for periocular images. This
model was compared to a model trained from scratch, showing that
the proposed transfer learning and ﬁne-tuning processes were cru-
cial for obtaining state-of-the-art results. The evaluation was per-
formed in the NICE.II and MobBIO databases, reporting EER values
of 5.92% and 5.42%, respectively.
Using a similar methodology, Silva et al. [116] fused deep rep-
resentations from iris and periocular regions by applying the Parti-
cle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to reduce the feature vector dimen-
sionality. The experiments were performed in the NICE.II database
and promising results were reported using only iris information and
also fusing iris and periocular traits, reaching EER values of 14.56%
and 5.55%, respectively.
Proenc¸ a and Neves [21] demonstrated that periocular recogni-
tion performance can be optimized by ﬁrst removing the iris and
sclera regions. The proposed approach, called Deep-PRWIS, con-
sists of a CNNs model that automatically deﬁnes the regions of in-
terest in the periocular input image. The input images were gen-
erated by cropping the ocular region (iris and sclera) belonging to
an individual and pasting the ocular area from another individual
in this same region. They obtained state-of-the-art results (closed-
world protocol) in the UBIRIS.v2 and FRGC databases, with EER
values of 1.9% and 1.1%, respectively.
Zhao and Kumar [141] developed a CNN-based method for pe-
riocular veriﬁcation. This method ﬁrst detects eyebrow and eye re-
gions using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and then uses
these traits as key regions of interest to extract features from the pe-
riocular images. The authors also developed a veriﬁcation oriented
loss function (Distance-driven Sigmoid Cross-entropy loss (DSC)).
Promising results were reported on six databases both in closed- and
open-world protocols, achieving EER values of 2.26% (UBIPr),
8.59% (FRGC), 7.68% (FOCS), 4.90% (CASIA-IrisV4-Distance),
0.14% (UBIRIS.v2) and 1.47% (VISOB).
Using NIR images acquired by mobile devices, Zhang et al. [64]
developed a method based on CNN models to generate iris and pe-
riocular region features. A weighted concatenation fused these fea-
tures. These weights and also the parameters of convolution ﬁlters
were learned simultaneously. In this sense, the joint representation
of both traits was optimized. They performed experiments in a sub-
set of the CASIA-Iris-Mobile-V1.0 database reporting EER values
of 1.13% (Periocular), 0.96% (Iris) and 0.60% (Fusion).
Regarding the works described in this section, we point out that
some deep learning-based approaches for iris recognition aim to de-
velop end-to-end systems by removing preprocessing steps (e.g.,
segmentation and normalization) since a failure in such processes
would probably affect recognition systems [16, 17, 115]. Further-
more, several works [21, 22, 64, 116, 141] show that the periocular
region contains discriminant features and can be used, or fused with
iris information, to improve the performance of biometric systems.
There are several works and applications with ocular images us-
ing deep learning frameworks, such as: spooﬁng and liveness detec-
tion [6, 7], left and right iris images recognition [8], contact lens de-
tection [142], iris location [9], sclera and iris segmentation [11, 12],
iris and periocular region detection [10], gender classiﬁcation [5],

iris/periocular biometrics by in-set analysis [143], iris recognition
using capsule networks [144], and sensor model identiﬁcation [13].

5. CHALLENGES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

In this section, we describe recent challenges and how approaches
are being developed to address these issues. We also point out some
future directions and new trends in ocular biometrics. The chal-
lenges and directions presented are as follows:

• Scalability: The term scalability refers to the ability of a bio-
metric system to maintain efﬁciency (accuracy) even when applied
to databases with a large number of images and subjects. The
largest ocular database available in the literature in terms of num-
ber of subjects is CASIA-IrisV4-Thousand [28], which has 20,000
images taken in a controlled environment at NIR wavelength from
1,000 subjects. In an uncontrolled environment and with VIS oc-
ular images, the largest database is VISOB [19], which is com-
posed of 158,136 images from 550 subjects. Although several
proposed methodologies achieve high decidability index in these
databases [16, 17, 19, 100, 118, 130, 135], indicating that these ap-
proaches have impressive and high separation of the intra- and inter-
class comparison distribution, can we state that these methodologies
are scalable? In this sense, it is necessary to research new methods
as well as new databases with a larger number of images/subjects to
evaluate the scalability of existing approaches in the literature.

• Multimodal biometric fusion in the visible spectrum: The peri-

ocular region traits are most utilized when there is a poor quality im-
age of the iris region or part of the face is occluded, which commonly
occurs in uncontrolled environments at VIS wavelength [22, 36]. A
promising solution in such scenarios is the fusion of several biomet-
ric traits contained in the images, for example, iris, periocular, ear,
and the entire face. In this way, there is still room for improvement in
the detection/segmentation of biometric traits contained in the face
region and also in algorithms for fusing features extracted from these
traits into various levels, as feature extraction, matching score, and
decision [145].
There are few publicly available multimodal databases, and those
available combine ocular modalities with other popular biometric
traits, such as face or speech. Researchers aiming to evaluate the
fusion of ocular biometric modalities against other less common
modalities need to create their own database or build a chimerical
one. In [146], a protocol for the creation and evaluation of multi-
modal biometric chimerical databases is discussed. Although eval-
uation on chimeric databases is not an ideal condition, it may be an
alternative to an initial/preliminary investigation [146].
• Multi-session: Regarding real-world applications, databases con-
taining images captured in more than one session in an uncontrolled
environment can be used to analyze the robustness of biometric sys-
tems, as images obtained at distinctive sessions often present high
intra-class variations caused by environmental changes, lighting, dis-
tance, and other noises such as occlusion, reﬂection, shadow, focus,
off-angle, etc. Images obtained at different sessions are important
for evaluating the variation of biometric traits through time and also
the effect of imaging in different environments, e.g., indoor and out-
door environment, daylight (natural), ofﬁce light (artiﬁcial), among
others. Some studies [19, 100, 118, 130, 132, 133] show that images
obtained in different sessions have a greater impact on the recogni-
tion of VIS images than of NIR images. This is because NIR images
are generally obtained under controlled environments while VIS im-
ages are taken under uncontrolled environments and because the

15

near-infrared spectrum best highlights the internal features of the
iris [19, 75, 132, 133, 135].

• Deep ocular representations: Several works have explored

strategies by modifying and/or evaluating input images for iris fea-
ture extraction using CNN models [16, 17, 21, 115, 132, 133, 141].
Zanlorensi et al. [115] showed that CNN models can extract more
discriminating features from the iris region using images without
classic preprocessing steps such as normalization and segmentation
for noise removal. Proenc¸ a and Neves [21] demonstrated that by
removing information from the eyeball region (iris and sclera), rep-
resentations extracted from the periocular region yields better results
in biometric systems and also that it is possible to train CNN mod-
els to deﬁne the region-of-interest automatically (i.e., ignoring the
information contained in the eyeball region) in an implicit way. Re-
cent works [16, 17, 132] attained promising results by training CNN
models to detect/learn similar regions in image pairs using pairwise
ﬁlters, that is, using a pair of iris images as input and a binary output
informing if the images belong to the same class. Features extracted
from these models generally achieve better results when compared
to models trained for veriﬁcation tasks, e.g., triplet and siamese net-
works [77]. Within this context, we can state that improvements can
be made by exploring different approaches to feed the CNN models
and also by exploring different architectures and loss functions.
• Mobile Cross-sensor images: Recently, some mobile (smart-
phones) ocular databases have been created (MICHE-I, VSSIRIS,
CSIP and VISOB) to study the use of images from different sen-
sors and environments in ocular biometrics. The images contained
in these databases are captured by the volunteer himself in uncon-
trolled environments and have several variabilities caused by occlu-
sion, shadows, lighting, defocus, distance, pose, gait, resolution, im-
age quality (usually affected by the environment lighting), among
others. Due to these characteristics, iris recognition using such im-
ages may not be reliable; thus some methodologies using periocular
region information have been proposed [25, 118, 119, 125]. Another
factor evaluated in these databases is the recognition using cross-
sensor images, i.e., the matching of features extracted from images
captured by different sensors. In this scenario, the largest database
in terms of subjects is VISOB [19] with 550 subjects and 158,136
images captured using 3 different sensors. In terms of number of
sensors, the largest database is CSIP [83] with 7 different sensors,
however, it contains only 2,004 images from 50 subjects. A next
step may be to create a mobile ocular database containing a larger
number of different sensor models (compared to existing ones) in
different sessions. Such a database can be used to assess biomet-
ric systems regarding the noise signature of each camera, as well as
the variations caused by the environments (sessions). It is essential
that this database has a large number of subjects, e.g., at least 1,000
(CASIA-IrisV4-Thousand).
• Cross-spectral scenario: A recent challenge that still has room
for improvement is the application of ocular biometric systems in
a cross-spectral scenario/setting. The term cross-spectral refers to
the matching of features extracted from images captured at differ-
ent wavelengths, usually VIS images against NIR ones. Based on
the conﬁguration of the experiment, the feature extraction training
step can be performed using images obtained at only one wavelength
(VIS or NIR) or both (VIS and NIR). The challenge of this sce-
nario is that the features present in NIR images are not always the
same as those extracted in VIS images. We can mention some re-
cent competitions and approaches that have been developed in this
scenario [40, 41, 75, 77, 138].

• Protocols: closed-world, open-world, and cross-dataset: Deep

learning-based biometric systems consist of learning distinct fea-
tures from traits. Those features can be used to generate a similar
(or dissimilar) score to perform a veriﬁcation task or can be fed to a
classiﬁer in order to perform an identiﬁcation task. How learned fea-
tures should be used is highly associated with the evaluation proto-
col. Ideally, experiments should be performed on different protocols
such as closed-world, open-world, and cross-dataset to evaluate the
robustness against different scenarios and the generalization ability
of these models.
In the closed-world protocol, different samples from the same
classes are present in the training and test sets, facilitating the use
of supervised classiﬁers for the biometric identiﬁcation task. This
means that the system is not able to handle new classes. This type of
system (closed-world) is usually evaluated with accuracy or recog-
nition rate metrics.
The open-world protocol must have samples from different classes in
the training and test sets. Within this protocol, the biometric system
must provide a score to allow the calculation of similarity (or dissim-
ilarity) from a pair of samples. The evaluation of open-world proto-
col is usually done with the biometric veriﬁcation task. Although the
veriﬁcation process is often performed in a pair-wise fashion (1:1)
and, by deﬁnition, in the veriﬁcation task, the identity of the sub-
ject to be veriﬁed is known a priori, in biometric competitions this
information is also used to generate scores from impostor pairs in or-
der to emulate spooﬁng attacks [18, 19, 39–41, 99]. The number of
impostor pairs is often the absolute majority during the assessment,
which makes open-world protocol very challenging. The evaluation
of competitions using the open-world protocol are usually done by
EER, AUC, or decidability.
Finally, the cross-dataset protocol consists of performing training
and testing using data acquired with different devices (sensors).
Therefore, two or more different databases are employed. This type
of evaluation brings another kind of issues in real environments, for
example, the inﬂuence of sensor quality and light spectrum sensitiv-
ity. Feature extraction methods should be robust enough to represent
the samples under different conditions.
In our opinion, the closed-world protocol is the most challenging
one, followed by open-world and closed-world, respectively. We
emphasize that, in order to assess robustness and generalization abil-
ity, all protocols should be considered by future competitions.

6. CONCLUSION

This work presented a survey of databases and competitions for
ocular recognition. For each database, we described information
such as image acquisition protocols, creation year, acquisition en-
vironment, images wavelength, number of images and subjects, and
modality. The databases were described and divided into three sub-
sections: NIR, VIS and cross-spectral, and multimodal databases.
Such databases included iris and periocular images for different ap-
plications such as recognition, liveness detection, spooﬁng, contact
lens detection, synthetic iris creation, among others. We also pre-
sented recent competitions in iris and periocular recognition and de-
scribed the approaches that achieved the best results. The top-ranked
methodologies using only iris traits and also the better overall result
(i.e., using both iris and periocular information) were detailed. Fi-
nally, we reviewed recent and promising works that applied deep
learning frameworks to ocular recognition tasks.
We also described recent challenges and approaches to these is-
sues, point out some future directions and new trends in the ocular
biometrics. In this context, some research directions can be high-

16

lighted, for example, recognition using (i) images taken in an uncon-
trolled environment [18, 19, 39], (ii) images obtained from mobile
devices at the VIS wavelength [19, 39], and (iii) cross-spectrum im-
ages [77, 138]. Aiming to study the scalability of deep iris and pe-
riocular features and images obtained by smartphones, a very close
real-world scenario, it may be interesting to create a database con-
taining a larger number of devices/sensors and subjects compared
with current databases [19, 63, 78, 79, 83], since the largest one
in terms of sensors (CSIP) have only 2,004 images captured from
50 subjects by 7 different devices and the largest database in terms
of subject (VISOB) have 158,136 images captured from 550 sub-
jects by only 3 different sensors. The application of machine learn-
ing techniques for segmentation, feature extraction, and recognition
can still be greatly explored [43] since promising results have been
achieved using them [6–8, 132, 133]. Other directions that also de-
serve attention are ocular recognition at distance, liveness detection,
multimodal ocular biometrics, and soft biometrics, which can be
used to improve the performance of ocular biometric systems.
