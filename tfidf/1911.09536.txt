Abstract

Dark markets are commercial websites that use Bitcoin to sell or broker transactions involving

drugs, weapons, and other illicit goods. Being illegal, they do not oﬀer any user protection, and

several police raids and scams have caused large losses to both customers and vendors over the past

years. However, this uncertainty has not prevented a steady growth of the dark market phenomenon

and a proliferation of new markets. The origin of this resilience have remained unclear so far, also due

to the diﬃculty of identifying relevant Bitcoin transaction data. Here, we investigate how the dark

market ecosystem re-organises following the disappearance of a market, due to factors including raids

and scams. To do so, we analyse 24 episodes of unexpected market closure through a novel datasets

of 133 million Bitcoin transactions involving 31 dark markets and their users, totalling 4 billion USD.

We show that coordinated user migration from the closed market to coexisting markets guarantees

overall systemic resilience beyond the intrinsic fragility of individual markets. The migration is

swift, eﬃcient and common to all market closures. We ﬁnd that migrants are on average more active

users in comparison to non-migrants and move preferentially towards the coexisting market with

the highest trading volume. Our ﬁndings shed light on the resilience of the dark market ecosystem

and we anticipate that they may inform future research on the self-organisation of emerging online

markets.

Introduction

Dark markets are commercial websites specialised in trading illicit goods. They are accessible via darknets

(e.g., Tor) and vary in specialization, technology, and primary supported language. Silk Road, the ﬁrst

modern dark market launched in 2011, limited its sales to drugs while other dark markets allow the

trading of weapons, fake IDs and stolen credit cards [1, 2]. Most markets facilitate trading between buyers
and vendors of illicit goods, but some of them involve a single vendor only. Regardless of these diﬀerences,

Bitcoin is the universally accepted currency, occasionally together with other cryptocurrencies.

Operating outside of law, dark markets do not oﬀer any protection to customers or vendors. This has

led to the proliferation of scam sales and market hacks. Furthermore, markets may suddenly disappear,

causing signiﬁcant losses to users. For example, Silk Road was shut down in 2013 by the FBI [3] and in

the same year Sheep Marketplace market was closed by its own administrator, who vanished with 100

million US dollars subtracted to its users [4]. Following these events, markets tried to prevent closure

by deploying technologies such as I2P [5], multisig [6] and rely more often on escrow services [7]. I2P is

an anonymous network layer designed to overcome censorship and multisig enables users to authorise a

transaction through multi signatures. Tumblers (also known as mixers) are services which obscure the

trail back to Bitcoin payments. Escrow services guarantee that markets do not hold users money, instead

a trusted third party holds the money until users conﬁrm they have received the shipment. Despite the

introduction of these measures, market closures continued to occur, both to police seizures and scams.

However, this uncertainty has not prevented a steady growth of both users and revenue of dark

markets. As of today, there are at least 38 active dark markets [8]. The diﬃculty to identify relevant
transactions from the Bitcoin blockchain has made it hard to quantify market volume [8, 10–12] but the

European authorities estimated dark markets drug sales from 2011 to 2015 to be 44 million dollars per

year. A later study estimated that, in early 2016, dark markets drug sales were between 170 million and

300 million dollars per year. [9]. Recently, the market Berlusconi known mostly for selling stolen IDs

was seised by the Italian police who estimated their annual transaction with 2 million euros [2].

The growth and resilience of the dark markets have attracted the attention of the scientiﬁc community.

The above mentioned diﬃculty to identify relevant transactions [8, 10–12] has forced researchers to rely

mostly on data scraped from dark markets websites [11, 13] (but dark markets administrators actively

ﬁght web scraping, seen as a threat), or users surveys [14, 15]. Police shutdowns were shown to correlate

with a sudden increase in drug listings in co-existing markets [16, 17], while the most comprehensive

study on closures covered 12 markets concluding ‘that the eﬀect of law enforcement takedowns is mixed

as best’ [11] and a recent analysis of a large 2014 police operation identiﬁed an impact of closures on

the drugs’ supply and demand but not the prices [13]. Recent research on how to attribute Bitcoin

anonymised addresses to named entities [18–20] has not been applied yet to investigate the dynamics of

dark markets, and only in few cases identifying dark-market related transactions has been the focus of

research [21].

Here, we investigate the dynamics of 24 market closures by looking at 31 markets in the period

between June 2011 to July 2019. We do so by investigating a novel dataset of Bitcoin transactions

involving dark markets assembled on the basis of the most recent identiﬁcation methods [22–24]. For

the ﬁrst time, we quantify the overall activity of the ma jor dark markets, in terms of number of users

and total volume traded. We reveal that the closure of a dark market, due to a police raid or an exit

scam, aﬀects only temporarily the market ecosystem activity, suggesting that dark markets are resilient.

We provide the ﬁrst systematic investigation of dark market users migration following an unexpected

closure, and show that closures aﬀects mostly low-active users, with highly-active users migrating quickly

to a new market. Finally, we show that migrant users tend to coordinate, with 66% of them choosing

the same new market, which is in most cases the one with largest volume.

Methods

Dark markets operate typically as an eBay for illicit goods where vendors advertise their products and

consumers request the shipment through the website. Transactions ﬂow from buyers to the dark market

2

that then sends the money to sellers after buyers conﬁrmation of receiving the goods. Consumers may

leave reviews that contribute to vendors’ reputation [7]. After multiple scam closures, nowadays dark

markets rely often on escrow systems. The dark market does not keep buyers’ bitcoins in local addresses

but instead sends it to an escrow service. After the buyer’s conﬁrmation, the escrow service transfer the

money to the seller.

Our analysis relies on a novel dataset of dark market transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. The

ledger of Bitcoin transactions (the blockchain) is publicly available and can be retrieved through Bitcoin

core [25] or a third-party API such as Blockchain.com [26]. It consists of the entire list of transaction

records, including time, transferred amount, origin and destination addresses. Addresses are identiﬁers
of 26 − 35 alphanumeric characters that can be generated at no cost by any user of Bitcoin, such that a
single Bitcoin wallet can be associated to multiple addresses. In fact, to ensure privacy and security, most

Bitcoin software and websites help users generate a new address for each transaction. Thus, blockchain

data has to be pre-processed to map groups of addresses to individual users.
We used data pre-processed by Chainalysis following the approach detailed in [22–24]. The pre-

processing relies on state-of-the-art heuristics [18–21, 27], including co-spending clustering, intelligence-

based clustering, behavioural clustering and entity identiﬁcation through direct interaction [23]. These

techniques rely on the observation of patterns in the Bitcoin protocol transactions and users behaviour.

Chainalysis Identiﬁcation of addresses related to illicit activities has been relied upon in many law

enforcement investigations [28, 29]. Due to this critical use of data, rigorous investigation and avoidance

of false positives is crucial. If an address can not be identiﬁed or clustered with certainty the address

will be tagged unnamed. This means that some addresses might belong to a dark market but are not

labelled as one (see more information on our dataset in Appendix 1.1, Figure 9).

We considered the entire transaction data of 31 dark markets (see Appendix 1.1) between June 18th,

2011 and July 24th, 2019. This dataset includes the ma jor markets on the darknet as identiﬁed by law

enforcement agencies reports [3, 30] and the World Health Organization [31]. We also considered the

transactions of the users who interacted with one of these markets (dark market’s nearest neighbours)

after their ﬁrst interaction with a dark market. Thus, each market ecosystem can be represented as an

egocentric network [32] of radius 2, where the market is the central node, its nearest neighbours represent

market users, and direct edges represent transaction occurring either between the market and one of its

neighbours, or between two neighbours. Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of our dataset, where

transactions within the square are the ones included in the dataset. After removing transactions to/from
cryptocurrency exchanges, the dataset contains ∼ 133 million transactions among over 38 million users.
The total number of addresses which directly interacted with dark markets is ∼ 8.3 million. The volume
of transactions sent and received by dark markets addresses amount to ∼ 4.2 billion dollars.

Figure 1: Dark market ego-network. Our dataset includes transaction between addresses belonging
to a dark market (in red) and its nearest neighbours (in black), as well as the transactions between
nearest neighbours and “other” Bitcoin addresses (in grey). Any transaction between two “other” nodes
is excluded from our dataset. In this schematic representation, the dotted square includes transactions
present in our dataset.

In order to gain information on the analysed markets, we collected additional data from the Gwern

archive on dark markets closures [1]. We also relied on law enforcement documents on closures, and

online forums [30, 31, 33] dedicated to discussing dark markets to compile comprehensive information (see

Appendix 1.1). Out of the selected markets, 12 performed exit scam, 9 were raided, 3 were voluntarily

closed by their administrators, and 7 are still active. Our dataset includes 2 markets in Russian language,

and the others are in English. Out of the 31 markets, 3 are markets dedicated to fake and stolen IDs

and credit cards. The primary currency on these market is Bitcoin. In Figure 2, we present the lifetime

of the selected markets and the reason behind their closure.

Results

After removing transactions to/from cryptocurrency exchanges, the dataset contains 133, 308, 118 trans-

actions among 38, 886, 758 users. The total number of users which directly interacted with dark market

is 8, 377, 478. The volume of transactions sent and received by dark markets addresses amount to 4.210

billion dollars, while the one received by dark markets address is 1.99 USD billion. Table 2 reports
characteristics of the 31 markets considered, including overall number of users and transaction volume.

The most active market in terms of number of users and traded volume is by far AlphaBay, followed by

Hydra.

Market resilience

The capacity of the dark market ecosystem to recover following the closure of a market can be studied

quantifying the evolution of the total volume traded by dark markets in time. Despite recurrent closures,

we ﬁnd that the number of markets has been relatively stable from 2014 (see Figure 3A). In addition, de-

spite closures, the total weekly volume sent/received by dark market addresses has grown from 2014 until

the end of 2019 (see Figure 3B). In fact, Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) analysis [34]

reveals that, following each dark market closure, the overall dark markets volume drops, but it recovers

quickly after, typically within 9.5 days, see Appendix 1.1. Starting from the end of 2018, however, we

observe a decrease in the total volume traded. It is important to note that, here, we considered the

total volume (in American dollars) sent/received across the entire dark market egocentric network (See

Figure 1).

red), or any other reason (in black). Values are calculated using a time window of one week.

User migration

The observation that dark markets are resilient to closure suggests that users may move to other markets

[13, 35]. We refer to this phenomenon as migration. In fact, migration was observed [36] after the closure

of the AlphaBay market when other markets, namely Hansa Market and Dream market, experienced an

abnormal spike in activity. In this section, we provide the ﬁrst systematic investigation of dark market

users migration, by studying the eﬀects of multiple closures. We identify migrant users in the following

way. For each market that was shut down, we identify users who started trading with another coexisting

market fol lowing the closure. Thus, users who were already trading on multiple markets before closure

are not considered migrants. Figure 4 shows the ﬂows of migrant users between markets. The overall

picture reveals a common behaviour across all closures since after each closure there is a ﬂow of migrants

to other coexisting markets.

6

Figure 4: Migration of users following a dark market closure. Flows of users migrating to another
coexisting market following a closure. The arrowhead points to the direction of migration, and the width
of the arrow represent the number of users. Markets are ordered clockwise according to the closing date
in ascending order starting from Silk Road Marketplace.

An important question is which fraction of users involved in illicit trading continue to exchange with

dark markets following a closure. The answer needs to consider that a large number of users interact

only once across their life time. For example, a study based on data up to 2013 found that most of the
minted Bitcoins were accumulated in addresses which never sent [19]. In our dataset ∼ 38% of the users
interacted only once. To identify users who stop trading with dark markets due to a market closure, we

compute the fraction of “returning users” over time, meaning the fraction of all users active in a given

week that are active also in the following week. After computing the fraction of returning users over

time, we normalise it by the fraction of returning users at the time of closure (so that the normalised

value of returning at that day is 1). Then, we consider the median across market closures. We ﬁnd that,

5 days after the closure of a dark market, only 85% of the expected number of returning users interacts

to another market. This result indicates that the closure does have an eﬀect, albeit the vast ma jority of
users seems to behave as normal (from the point of view of the following interaction).

7

Who is migrating?

The observation that some users stop trading following a dark market closure but the total volume traded

in dark markets does not decrease could indicate that migrant users are on average more active than

others.

We test this hypothesis by computing the activity of migrant users before and after closure. We

refer to the ﬁrst dark market a user was interacting with as its home market. For all users (migrant

and non-migrant), we measure the total volume exchanged with any other user in our dataset including
the home market. We ﬁnd that the median volume exchanged by migrant users is ∼ 10times larger
than the volume exchanged by non-migrant users (see Figure 5A), with the median volume exchanged

summing to 3882.9 USD for migrant users and to 387.2 USD for non-migrant users. The mean on

the other hand is 716441.9 USD and 17529.7 USD for migrant and non-migrant users respectively (see

Appendix 1.1 for the spending distribution of migrant and non-migrants). Similar conclusions can be

drawn by considering the volume exchanged with the home market only, which has median value of 263

USD and for non-migrant users and 74.3 USD for migrant users and a mean value of 2725.1 USD and

475.9 USD for migrant and non-migrant users respectively (see Figure 5B).

The activity distribution of migrants is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the non-migrant users’ distribution

(using Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, p < 0.01, see Table 3 in Appendix 1.1).

Figure 5: Migrants are more active than other users. (A) Total volume exchanged by migrant
users (orange box-plots) and non-migrant users (blue box-plots) before the closure of their home market.
(B) Volume exchanged by migrant users (orange box-plots) and non-migrant users (blue box-plots) with
their home market. The horizontal line in each box represents the median. The lower box boundary
shows the ﬁrst quartile, and the upper one shows the third quartile. The whiskers show the minimum
and maximum values within the 1.5 lower and upper interquartile range.

Coordination in the dark

In our dataset, in all cases but one, users could choose between at least two surviving markets when

their home market closed. A natural question is therefore how migrant users decide where to migrate.

8

In Figure 6, we show the evolution of the trading volume shares of the shut down market and the

top two destination markets in the periods preceding and following a closure. We ﬁnd that the top two

destination markets experience an increase in share starting 2 days after the closure, and saturating after

about 6 days to around 27%.

Figure 6: Migration decision and impact.
(A) The median share (across closures) of a closed
market (blue market), the top destination market for the migrant users (orange line) and the second top
destination for migrant users (green line). The shaded area represents the 50% interquartile range. Value
are computed using a rolling window of one week. Figures B-D show the probability of a market to be
chosen for migration given its rank at the time of coexisting market closure in comparison to the random
model. Markets are ranked in descending order according to (B) the number of overlapping users they
have with the closed market excluding Russian markets (C) the total trading volume in USD and (D)
the total trading volume in USD excluding Russian markets from the ranking. The random model in
the ﬁgures B-D represent a model where users can move to any existent market with equal probability.

We investigate the characteristics of the ﬁrst destination market for migrant users, by ranking coexist-

ing markets according to the total trading volume in USD at the time of closure and the total number of

common users between the shut down and the coexisting market before closure. We ﬁnd that, regardless
of the reason behind closure, users do not migrate randomly and chose to move to the market with the

highest trading volume which, in some cases, is also the market with the highest number of common

users.
Focusing on the ﬁrst week after closure, we ﬁnd that, on average, one market absorbs 66.1% ± 16.1
of all migrant users. Only 4% of the users migrate to more than one coexisting market simultaneously

after the closure. What is this market? Figure 6A shows that, in 36.4% of the closures considered, it

is the one sharing the larger number of common users with the closed market, while the chances that

users select the second and the third rank is 31.8%. Users do not choose to migrate to markets with

rank lower than the third.

Figure 6B shows that, when markets are ranked according to the volume of their transactions, the

second-largest is preferred in the ma jority of cases (31.8%). However, a closer look at the data reveals

that the Russian market occupies often the top ranks in terms of volume but it tends not to be the

preferred migration harbour, probably due language and geographical barriers. Excluding the Russian

market from the ranking, in fact, we ﬁnd that the largest market is selected 41% of the times (see Figure

9

6C).

We compare the users’ decisions with a null random model, where at each closure users move with

equal probability to any of the existent markets. The random probability P of rank i to be chosen for

migration after m closures is equal to

Pi =

j=1 1/cj

,

(cid:80)m

m

where cj is the number of coexisting markets at the time of closure j . We ﬁnd that the results of
the random procedure are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from actual data, conﬁrm the existence of a strong

coordination between users (see Figure 6)

Conclusion

Considering a novel dataset of Bitcoin transactions for 31 large dark markets and their users, we in-

vestigated how the darknet market ecosystem is aﬀected by the unexpected closure of a market in the

period between 2013 and 2019. The markets under study diﬀered in speciality, language, and date of

creation, and 24 of them were closed abruptly due to reasons including police raids and scams. We

found that the total volume traded on dark markets drops only temporarily following a dark market

closure, revealing that the ecosystem exhibits a remarkable resilience. We identiﬁed the origin of this

resilience, by focusing on individual users, and unveiled a swift and ubiquitous phenomenon of migration

between recently closed markets and other coexisting ones. We found that migrants are more active in
terms of total transaction volume compared to users who do not migrate, that they tend to privilege the

same unique market as destination and that this is generally the biggest market in terms of the total

trading volume. Our ﬁndings shed new light on the consequences of sudden closure and/or police raids

on dark market, which had been previously raised in the literature and among law enforcement enti-

ties [9, 13, 30]. Interesting future research directions include the role of market closure on the emergence

of new markets, reﬁning the analysis to investigate whether scam closures and police raids may have

so-far neglected eﬀects on user migration, and broaden the research to include the eﬀect of online forums

on the performance of existing markets as well as on the migration choices after a closure [33].

1.1 Clustering techniques

In Bitcoin, multiple addresses can belong to one user; grouping these addresses reduces the complexity

of the ledger and Bitcoin anonymity [19]. Clustering techniques rely on how Bitcoin’s protocol works,

users behaviour on the blockchain, Bitcoin’s transaction graph structure and ﬁnally, machine learning.

Methods relying on Bitcoin’s protocol speciﬁcally exploit what is known as change addresses: Bitcoins

available in an address have to be spent as a whole. Figure 7 shows an example of a change address. User

A’s wallet has two addresses, one contains 1BTC and another has 2BTC. User A would like to transfer

0.25BTC to user B , as shown in Figure 7A. After transferring the 0.25BTC to B , the change (0.75BTC)

will not stay in the same address. Bitcoin protocol will create another address, also assigned to A, where

the 0.75BTC change will be stored. By observing this pattern, a heuristic technique proposed in [27]

suggests that these addresses can be grouped, as they belong to one user.

13

Figure 7: How Bitcoin’s protocol handles transactions with change. (A) A transaction between
users A and user B , where A wants to transfer 0.25 Bitcoins to B . User A has two addresses, one with
1 Bitcoin and the other with 2 Bitcoins. User B has one address, containing 1 Bitcoin. (B) How a
transaction is conducted under Bitcoin protocol. User A ﬁrst address transfers 0.25 Bitcoin to user B
ﬁrst address. The change of 0.75 Bitcoin does not stay in User A ﬁrst address 1, but appears, instead,
as another transaction to a new address. The dotted boundaries in both ﬁgures represent a grouping of
these addresses, as they belong to one user. A solid arrow represents an executed Bitcoin transaction,
while the dotted arrow represents a desired transaction.

Since users can have multiple addresses, they can use multiple of these addresses to transfer Bitcoins

in a single transaction. For example, Figure 8A shows a case where user A controls 3 diﬀerent addresses.

Each address has a diﬀerent amount of Bitcoins, 1, 4 and 2.5 respectively. User A wants to transfer 5

Bitcoins to user B , and two addresses will be used to complete the transaction as shown in Figure 8B.

This observation allows the grouping of these two addresses as a single user [27].

14

Figure 8: Sending from multiple inputs in Bitcoin (A) A desired transaction between users A and
B , where A wants to send 5 Bitcoins to user B . User A has 3 diﬀerent addresses with 1, 4 and 2.5
Bitcoins respectively. User B has one address containing 1 Bitcoin. (B) How the transaction will be
conducted under the Bitcoin protocol. User A will use two addresses to complete the transaction. Both
addresses will send to one address belonging to user B . The dotted boundaries in both ﬁgures represent
a grouping of these addresses as they belong to one user. The solid arrows represent an already executed
Bitcoin transaction while the dotted arrow represents a desired transaction.

The work in [21] challenged these heuristics, showing the possibility of having false positives and not

taking into consideration changes in the protocol. The work suggests instead a manual process, where

the behaviour of each entity is investigated. Page rank (network centrality measure [37]) was also used
to identify important addresses [38]; however, the addresses were already grouped using the heuristics

introduced by [27]. Machine learning was also shown to identify addresses which should be grouped as

one with 77% accuracy.

Mapping addresses to an actual identity is more challenging. Some entities already publish their

public key for donation and payment, such as Wikimedia Foundation [39]. The only research that

introduced a method for mapping a collection of addresses to a real-world identity is [21], through direct

interaction with the address. In this work, researchers directly engaged in 344 transactions with diﬀerent

services including mining pools, exchanges, dark markets and gambling websites.

The introduction of these heuristics did not only challenge Bitcoin’s anonymity but also eased the

regulation of Bitcoin. Companies specialising in blockchain analytics started to capitalise on these

heuristics and provide tools for exchanges and law enforcement entities to facilitate regulatory eﬀorts.

For our analysis of dark markets, our data was provided by Chainalysis [40], which is a blockchain

analytics company. Chainalysis aided several investigations led by diﬀerent law enforcement entities,

including the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) [29].

Our dataset sampling approach (from the entire Bitcoin transactions) deploys a complex network

perspective. Transactions on the blockchain can be modelled as a directed weighted graph where a node

15

represents a user, and a directed edge between two nodes A and B represents a transaction from user A to

user B . Depending on the clustering algorithm, a node can represent one address or multiple addresses.

A node can also be labelled as a speciﬁc entity or unlabelled (unnamed). Figure 9 shows a sketch of

the network and the diﬀerent possible meanings of a node. For example in Figure 9, the black unnamed

node on the right side is a representation of two diﬀerent addresses clustered together, however, they

were not attributed to an entity thus remained unnamed.

Figure 9: A dark market’s Bitcoin transaction network. A schematic representation of our dataset
as a complex network. Nodes represent users, and a direct edge between two nodes represents a trans-
action in the direction of the edge. Nodes can represent diﬀerent abstractions as shown by the dotted
rhombus. Starting from the right side, the unnamed black node represents a cluster of two diﬀerent
addresses which, however, was not attributed to a speciﬁc entity. The dark market node(in dark red,
Silk Road Market), is a representation of 3 addresses and attributed by the algorithm to the market.
The black named node on the left side of Silk Road Market node is a representation of 4 addresses and
named to belong to a speciﬁc entity. Finally, the black unnamed node at the bottom left side of the
ﬁgure, represents one address.

Table 2: Dark markets overall activity. The activity of the dark markets as observed in our dataset.
For each market, the table reports the total volume sent and received by dark market addresses. It also
reports the total number of users who sent (in-degree) and received (out-degree) Bitcoins to/from dark
market addresses.

Moving Average Convergence Divergence Analysis

To further quantify the changes in dark markets traded volume, we calculate the Moving Average Con-

vergence Divergence (MACD) of the weekly trading volume. The MACD is an trading indicator used in

stock markets to quantify price movements and ﬂuctuations. It is composed of three time series. Firstly,

the MACD, calculated as the diﬀerence between the exponential weighted moving average of the trading

volume for a period of 12 weeks and the exponential weighted moving average of the trading volume for

a period of 26 weeks. Secondly, the signal line, computed as the 9 weeks exponential weighted moving

average of the MACD time series. Finally, the last time series, known as the histogram, representing the

diﬀerence between the MACD and the signal line.

Figure 10 shows the indicator behaviour across time. For each closure, there is a ﬂuctuation in the

MACD line and the histogram line indicates a downward change in the overall dark markets volume.

However, an upward change can be observed after the closures indicating that dark markets recover.

MACD signal line (orange line) for dark markets trading volume from 2013 till 2016. (B) The MACD
histogram (blue line) for the dark markets trading volume from 2013 to the end of 2016. (C) The MACD
(blue line) and MACD (orange line) signal line for dark markets trading volume from 2017 until July,
2019. (D) The MACD histogram (blue line) for the dark markets trading volume from 2017 until July,
2019. Vertical dashed lines represent markets closure.

Migrant and non migrants

In the main text we show that for each closed market, migrant users are more active in terms of the

total amount they send and received overall, speciﬁcally with the closed dark market. In this section,

we show the distribution of the migrants and non-migrants activity across all dark markets. Figure 11

shows that activity for migrants overall is higher than the non-migrants.

sent and received across all closed dark markets for migrants (orange line) and non migrants (blue line).

distribution.
