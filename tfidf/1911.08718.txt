Abstract

Shadow removal is an essential task for scene understand-
ing. Many studies consider only matching the image contents,
which often causes two types of ghosts: color in-consistencies
in shadow regions or artifacts on shadow boundaries (as
shown in Figure. 1). In this paper, we tackle these issues in
two ways. First, to carefully learn the border artifacts-free
image, we propose a novel network structure named the dual
hierarchically aggregation network (DHAN). It contains a se-
ries of growth dilated convolutions as the backbone without
any down-samplings, and we hierarchically aggregate multi-
context features for attention and prediction, respectively.
Second, we argue that training on a limited dataset restricts
the textural understanding of the network, which leads to the
shadow region color in-consistencies. Currently, the largest
dataset contains 2k+ shadow/shadow-free image pairs. How-
ever, it has only 0.1k+ unique scenes since many samples
share exactly the same background with different shadow
positions. Thus, we design a shadow matting generative ad-
versarial network (SMGAN) to synthesize realistic shadow
mattings from a given shadow mask and shadow-free image.
With the help of novel masks or scenes, we enhance the cur-
rent datasets using synthesized shadow images. Experiments
show that our DHAN can erase the shadows and produce
high-quality ghost-free images. After training on the synthe-
sized and real datasets, our network outperforms other state-
of-the-art methods by a large margin. The code is available:

Introduction

Shadows are a common phenomenon in nature. Cast shad-
ows, which often appear in the opposite direction of a light
source, form when the light from an illuminant is blocked
by an object. Removing these shadows is essential because
shadows may degrade the performance of many computer
vision tasks, such as object detection and tracking (Mikic et
al. 2000; Khan et al. 2015). Early approaches try to automat-
ically detect shadow regions (Guo, Dai, and Hoiem 2013;
Khan et al. 2015) or to do so with user input (Gong and
Cosker ; Yang, Tan, and Ahuja 2012) ﬁrst, after which they

reduces the ghost.

transform the shadows to match the background. For deep
learning-based approaches, Qu et al. (2017) train a neural
network considering multi-context features (global seman-
tics and low-level details). Then, Wang, Li, and Yang (2018)
conduct joint shadow removal/detection using a stacked gen-
erative adversarial network. Hu et al. (2018) retrain their
shadow detection network to directly train shadow removal
network. More recently, Hu et al. (2019) train a network us-
ing an unpaired dataset without paired supervisions.
However, current deep learning-based techniques have
two major drawbacks. First, we argue that previous network
structures are not carefully designed for shadow removal.
While the goal of shadow removal is restoring the color
from the shadow image, the shadow border also plays a vital
role in the visual quality. For example, DeShadowNet (Qu
et al. 2017) learns only the shadow matting from multi-
context features other than the full image using the pre-
trained VGG19, and the artifacts will still show on the bor-
der. DSC (Hu et al. 2018) learns using a direction-aware at-
tention model, which well captures the directional details
well and also preserves more shadow boundaries. Thus, a

 
 
 
 
 
 
carefully designed model is criterial. In addition, the com-
munity lacks a high-quality image pairs (shadow/shadow-
free) for shadow removal and joint learning on shadow re-
moval and detection (shadow/shadow-free/mask). Since the
largest available dataset contains only 0.1k+ unique scenes,
and the performance of unsupervised learning is limited.
We argue that such limited scenes will hugely inﬂuence the
color consistency between the shadow and shadow-free re-
gions because training on small dataset can not understand
the scenes well.
In this work, we design a novel network structure to
erase shadows and produce high-quality shadow-free im-
ages according to the following observations: the shadow
and shadow-free images share the same semantic informa-
tion and shadow removal speciﬁcally and only needs to learn
the shadow. Since the semantic knowledge is the same and
the network needs to focus on low-level features, differ-
ent from others, an image processing network (Chen, Xu,
and Koltun 2017) serves as a useful starting point for our
method. In detail, this network uses several dilated convolu-
tions (Yu and Koltun 2015) linearly with a growing dilated
rate to capture multi-contexts and preserve useful low-level
features. Based on this backbone, we hierarchically aggre-
gate dilated convolutions to achieve better feature reuse (Yu
et al. 2017). Then, to speciﬁcally learn the shadow regions,
we design the hierarchical aggregation attention model with
the help of multi-contexts and the attention loss from the
shadow mask. Non-linear feature aggregation helps our at-
tention to gain the knowledge from multiple previous layers,
and dilated convolutions preserve the details well.
In addition, we get our inspiration from the nature in
that a cast shadow comes from the opposite direction of
the light source. When an object moves, a single shadow-
free image can produce countless shadow images. Thus,
if we train the network to synthesize shadow images from
the corresponding masks and shadow-free images, the net-
work will also produce the novel shadows according to the
novel mask. It is much easier to collect the required data for
shadow synthesis than for triples of paired shadow/shadow-
free/mask. Thus, we design a novel shadow synthesis net-
work using GAN (Goodfellow et al. 2014) to enlarge the cur-
rent datasets. Instead of learning the shadow image directly,
our network learns the shadow matting ﬁrst and produces
the high-quality shadow from the original shadow-free im-
age and matting. Although these images are synthesized us-
ing neural network, they still have a similar distributions
to the real natural scene compared with those from com-
puter games (Sidorov 2019). In our shadow synthesis, we
assume the scenes contain only cast shadows with the ob-
jects outside the scene. Experiments shows that our setting
also works well in other situations.
We summarize our major contributions as follows.
• We design a joint learning framework, named Dual Hi-
erarchical Aggregation Network (DHAN), for shadow
removal with the help of shadow detection. The pro-
posed network hierarchically aggregates the dilated multi-
contexts features and attentions, respectively.
• We design and train a Shadow Matting GAN on current

paired shadow datasets. Then, the novel paired samples
are obtained from the well-trained network with novel
masks or scenes. Finally, we train shadow-related tasks
using augmented datasets.
• Experiments on real and synthetic data indicate that our
algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, es-
pecially on the visual quality.

Related Work

Shadow Removal Early works often erase shadows via user
interaction or hand-crafted features (Guo, Dai, and Hoiem
2013; Khan et al. 2015). Inspired by the convolution neural
network-based method, Qu et al. (2017) propose a multi-
stream neural network for removing the shadows according
to global-and-local contexts, and Hu et al. (2018) use a fully
convolutional network structure but with direction-aware at-
tention. For learning shadow removal and detection jointly,
Wang, Li, and Yang (2018) proposed a stacked GAN where
the learned shadow mask serves as the attention for the re-
moval. Ding et al. (2019) extend this method by strong net-
work and learning recurrently.
Shadow Synthesis For it is hard to collect larger shadow re-
moval datasets, Gryka, Terry, and Brostow (2015) generate
the shadow images from graphics tools and Sidorov (2019)
generate the shadow dataset by controlling the lights in the
video game. However, scenes or shadows that are rendered
by computer graphics are signiﬁcantly different from natu-
ral scenes. (Le et al. 2018; Le and Samaras 2019) propose
a two-stage network for generating the adversarial shadow
images before shadow detection, and they also use this idea
to remove shadows by enhancing the shadow strength. Fo-
cusing on the limitation of a paired dataset, Hu et al. (2019)
train a neural network to remove shadows from unpaired
shadow/shadow-free images. It also contains an auxiliary
network for shadow synthesis. However, their synthesized
shadows are not learned using the paired dataset and their
shadow generator is used in cycle-consistency loss only.
Shadow Detection Some traditional methods use physical
models of illumination and color for shadow detection (Sal-
vador, Cavallaro, and Ebrahimi 2004; Panagopoulos et al.
2011). Others describe image regions by hand-crafted fea-
tures, such as color (Lalonde, Efros, and Narasimhan 2010),
texture (Vicente, Hoai, and Samaras 2017), then recognize
these regions by classiﬁer. However, these approaches are
not well suited for various natural scenes. Current state-of-
the-art shadow detection methods are based on the power
of convolution neural network, such as learning shadow
edges (Khan et al. 2015; Shen, Wee Chua, and Leman 2015)
and designing attention modules by considering the direc-
tion (Hu et al. 2018), recurrent attention (Zhu et al. 2018)
and distraction (Zheng et al. 2019).

Proposed Methods

Dual Hierarchical Aggregation Network

Given a shadow image Ishadow , our method learns the
shadow-free image If ree using the proposed network with

the help of the attention loss (shadow mask M ) in a sin-
gle forward process. As previously discussed, our back-
bone structure is based on the context aggregation net-
work (CAN) (Chen, Xu, and Koltun 2017; Zhang, Ng,
and Chen 2018) for image processing. Speciﬁcally, we
extract
the hyper-column features from the pre-trained
VGG19 (CONV1 2, CONV2 2, CONV3 2, CONV4 2 and
CONV5 2) and the original RGB image serves as an aug-
mented network input. Then, we encode these multi-context
features using several dilated convolutions with a growing
dilate rate. Each convolutional block follows an Instance
Normalization and LeakyReLU layer. Previous studies show
that this network structure works well in image processing
tasks, such as Nonlocal de-hazing and L0 smoothing since
there is no down-sampling or stride convolution in the con-
text encoding, the low-level details can be well preserved.
Although shadow removal is similar to low-level task, it
speciﬁcally needs to learn the shadow regions. Possible so-
lutions are to learn the particular region using partial con-
volution (Liu et al. 2018) or gated convolution (Yu et al.
2019). However, these attention mechanisms are designed
for image in-painting. Thus, they need to ﬁll the region using
global semantic contexts and work in a Unet-like structure.
Thus, to speciﬁcally learn the shadows and preserve low-

level details, we design dual hierarchical aggregations for

spatial attentions and mixed layer features, respectively. In
detail, as shown in Figure. 2, we build the attention module
by aggregating the features from multiple previous layers in
a hierarchical layer aggregation style (Yu et al. 2017). Our
n layer dual hierarchical aggregation network DH ANn =

Tn × ATn merges the features in a tree-like structure for
richer context attention. In it, Tn and ATn can be deﬁned as:

Tn = N (Rn
n−1 (x), ..., Rn
1 (x), Ln
1 (x), Ln
2 (x))
ATn = AN (ARn
n−1 (x), ..., ARn
1 (x), Ln
1 (x), Ln
2 (x))

(1)

where N and AN are the aggregation node and attention
aggregation node, respectively. N (·) means the feature con-
catenation. R, AR and feature layer L are deﬁned as:

ARn
m (x) =

1 (x) × ARn
Ln
1 (x) = DBk=2n−1 (Rn

Ln
2 (x) = DBk=2n (Ln
1 (x))
(cid:26)ATm

m (x) =
Tm (Rn
ATm (ARn

if m = n-1
m+1 (x)) otherwise,
if m = n-1
m+1 (x)) otherwise,
where DBk=x represents the x-dilated convolution. Thus,
each aggregated feature is spatially reweighed by the multi-
context attention. In addition, we also use the ground truth
shadow mask as the supervision for the attention.
In each aggregation node (as shown in Figure. 3), we use
a squeeze-and-excitation block (Hu, Shen, and Sun 2018)
to re-weight the importance of each feature channel. Then,
a 3 × 3 convolution is added to squeeze the features and
match the original channels. Notice that, the S igmoid(·)
layer is added only at the end of the attention aggregation
nodes (AR). Finally, a spatial pooling pyramid (as shown
in Figure. 2) (He et al. 2015) is added at the end of the last
aggregation block for multi-context features remixing.
Loss Functions By considering the semantic measures
and low-level details in multiple contexts, we train our net-
work using the multi layer perception loss (Zhang, Ng, and
Chen 2018; Johnson, Alahi, and Fei-Fei 2016) LΦ in the
pixel and feature domain as follows:

the original images (k = 0 in Equation. 3) between the nat-
ural shadow-free image If ree and the generated I
f ree using
the L1 loss with weight λl . For the attention loss, we use the
binary cross entropy (BCE) loss between the predicted mask
M (cid:48) and the ground truth mask M as follows:

(cid:88) −[M log(M (cid:48) ) + (1 − M )log(1 − M (cid:48) )] (4)

(cid:48)

Lm =

N

Where N is the total number of pixels. In addition, the con-
volution neural network might also preserve the shadow bor-
der in the images, which will also degrades the shadow re-
moval quality. Thus, we use the adversarial loss as (Isola
et al. 2017) in our approach. By considering our DHAN as
the generator, the discriminator D is constructed with sev-
eral convolution blocks. We simply discriminate the patches
in the real shadow-free image If ree and the predicted I
given the shadow image Ishadow . The discriminator is opti-
mized to identify the generated image that pushes the gener-
ator towards realistic shadow-free images. The discriminator
loss is as follows:

to 100 and β equals to 20 empirically.

SM-GAN: Shadow Matting GAN

As discussed in the introduction, one of the key issues in
current shadow removal methods is the limitation of the
paired dataset. However, with respect to the various types
of shadow masks and scenes, it is hard to collect a large
dataset with paired shadow/shadow-free images. The state-
of-the-art SRD dataset (Qu et al. 2017) and ISTD (Wang,
Li, and Yang 2018) contains only 100+ different scenes
and 10+ unique shadow types. In addition, the environmen-
tal light changes so fast that it is impossible to take pairs
of shadow/shadow-free images under the same light condi-
tions, even in a ﬂash. The uncertainty of the light transform-
ing between shadow/shadow-free images inﬂuences the ac-
curacy of the network. For these reasons, we argue that the
application range of current learning-based shadow removal
algorithms is limited and training using limited scenes will
cause color inconsistencies between shadow and shadow-
free regions. However, it is far easier to collect the natu-
ral shadow-free images and random masks than to collect

(cid:48)

(cid:48)

(cid:48)

(cid:48)

the corresponding shadow/shadow-free/shadow-mask sets.
Thus, we synthesize the shadow image using the random
shadow mask and the shadow-free image via the GAN to
improve the accuracy of shadow networks and extend their
capabilities to larger natural domains.
As shown in Figure.4, using the knowledge of the shadow
image Ishadow , the shadow mask M and the correspond-
ing shadow-free image If ree in the current dataset, we train
shadow synthesis as a paired task (Isola et al. 2017) using
the GAN. Speciﬁcally, we train a generator to synthesize
the shadow image I
shadow from the corresponding shadow-
free image If ree and mask M . Then, the discriminator is
optimized to identify whether the synthesized shadow im-
age I
shadow is real or not. Since there is a corresponding
ground truth image Ishadow in the dataset, apart from ad-
versarial loss from the discriminator, we restrict the simi-
larity of the I
shadow and Ishadow in a supervised manner.
Instead of generating the shadow image directly, we learn
the shadow matting Imatting following the former observa-
tion (Qu et al. 2017): Ishadow = Imatting × If ree . Thus, our
shadow synthesis network can be written as follows:

shadow = G(If ree , M ) × If ree

(6)
where G(·) is the generator of our shadow matting GAN.
The supervised losses in the shadow matting generator are
similar to our shadow removal: We use the multi-scale per-
ceptual loss to measure the prediction quality and adversar-
ial loss to guarantee the realism of the output. Then, we up-
date the parameters in the discriminator network D to recog-
nize whether the generated shadow image is real or not. The
generator of our SM-GAN has a similar structure with the
CycleGAN (Zhu et al. 2017). For simplicity, the discrimi-
nator is constructed with 5 convolution layers with ReLU
non-linear activation and Batch Normalization layer, which
is similar to our shadow removal network.
After training, the generator in SMGAN can be easily
used to sample novel domain examples, such as the novel
background and novel shadow mask (as shown in the novel
mask/background of Figure.4). Here, we use the shadow-
free images in USR (Hu et al. 2019) and shadow masks
from ISTD training set to synthesize the shadow images
for data augmentation. For each shadow-free image in the
USR dataset, we randomly choose 3 images from the train-
ing mask of the ISTD dataset to generate shadow. The ex-
periments show that this kind of setting is sufﬁcient for the
shadow removal and detection tasks.

Experiments

In this section, ﬁrst, we conduct the shadow removal experi-
ments using standard benchmarks, the ISTD (Wang, Li, and
Yang 2018) and the SRD (Qu et al. 2017). The SRD contains
2k+ and 408 images for training and testing, respectively. In
ISTD, there is 1.3k and 540 images for training and testing,
respectively. On both datasets1 , we jointly learn the shadow
removal and attention (shadow mask) using the proposed
DHAN. In addition, we retrain these tasks on the dataset
containing both real and synthesized shadow images. Then,
we evaluate the effectiveness of our synthesized shadows
for shadow detection on SBU (Vicente et al. 2016) dataset,
which contains 4k+ and 0.6k+ images for training and test-
ing, respectively. Finally, we conduct the ablution study on
the network structure, the quality of shadow synthesis and
the network capabilities.
Implementation Detail We train all our models using
TensorFlow framework and optimize the network on Adam

calculate the shadow matting using the shadow/shadow-free pairs
and generate the binary mask via thresh-holding.

optimizer (Kingma and Ba 2014) with a ﬁxed learning rates
of 2 ∗ 10−4 and 10−4 in the generator and the discriminator,
respectively. In training, we randomly resize the original im-
age from 256p to 480p, thereby retaining the original aspect
radio rather than cropping the image. We set the batch size
to 1 and train the network in over 100 epochs for shadow
synthesis and 150 epochs for shadow removal (60 epochs
for the augmented datasets). For testing, we evaluate all the
images in their original size. It takes 0.2s for our network to
generate a shadow-free image with a resolution of 640x480
on a single NVIDIA TITAN V GPU. On shadow removal,
we follow the previous works and evaluate the RMSE on the
LAB color space in the shadow (S) and non-shadow (NS) re-
gions. In addition, we also report the PSNR and SSIM for the
shadow region (SSIM-S and PSNR-S, respectively) to eval-
uate whether it can produce high-quality shadow removal
results. To evaluate on shadow detection, we use the Bal-
ance Error Rate (BER) for the shadow (S) and non-shadow
region (NS) as in previous works. The BER is deﬁned as fol-
lows: BER = 1 − 1
T N +F P ), where TP, TN,
FP and FN are the total numbers of the true positives, true
negatives, false positives and false negatives, respectively.

Comparison with the State-of-the-art Methods

Shadow Removal We compare ours results with those of
the state-of-the-art shadow removal methods, including ST-
CGAN (Wang, Li, and Yang 2018) that jointly conducts
shadow removal and detection, DSC (Hu et al. 2018) that
removes shadows using a direction-aware attention mecha-
nism, and DeShadowNet (Qu et al. 2017) conducts shadow
removal using multi-context features and the shadow mat-
ting loss. Apart from deep learning-based methods, we also
compare our algorithm with some open-sourced traditional
methods (Guo, Dai, and Hoiem 2013; Gong and Cosker ;
Yang, Tan, and Ahuja 2012). Note that, in order to con-
duct a fair comparison, all the results and ﬁgures are pro-
vided by the authors or taken from the original papers. Since
the training codes of ST-CGAN and DeShadowNet are not
publicly available, we evaluate their performances only on
their own dataset. As shown in Figure. 5, our method pro-
vides much better visual quality than the others on both two
standard datasets. In these samples, previous works produce
many ghosts because of the remaining shadow boundaries
or color inconsistencies. For example, DeShadowNet learns
the shadow matting only where the restored color might
not match the background. In addition, the DSC and De-
ShadowNet will cause sharp shadow boundaries since their
network structures need to down-sample and up-sample in
the multi-contexts. Meanwhile, due to the limited dataset,
they all lack better scene understandings. However, the pro-
posed method (Ours) has minimal artifacts in the shadow
boundaries and the synthesized dataset used as augmenta-
tion (Ours+DA) provides much better color consistency. For
the numerical evaluation in Table. 1, all the methods can
successfully learn the shadow-free region with the help of
network; however, it is clear that our DHAN outperforms
the others, especially on the shadow regions, because of the
effectiveness of our attention model and attention loss. Ad-
ditionally, training on the augmented synthesized shadow
dataset helps a lot in shadow and non-shadow regions since
it successfully enlarges the knowledge of current dataset.
Note that, on SRD dataset, even though ISTD dataset con-
tains larger color differences between the training pairs in
the shadow-free region and our network try to ﬁt these map-
ping in shadow synthesis, the synthesized shadows also help
the scenes understanding on SRD dataset.

learning method ST-CGAN (Wang, Li, and Yang 2018) and
adversarial shadow-based methods ADNet (Le et al. 2018).
As shown in Table. 2, although our network is not particu-
larly designed for shadow detection, it still gets better results
than those other methods under the same backbone. Our
network also obtains comparable results with the state-of-
the-art methods using the powerful pre-trained ResNext101
model and multi-contexts supervisions. The shadows in the
SBU dataset are much more challenging and complex than
simple cast shadows. However, our synthesized shadow still
helps, as in Figure. 6 and Table. 2.

Ablation Studies

Network Structure We evaluate the contributions of our
network structure on the SRD dataset. As shown in Ta-
ble. 3 and Figure. 7, our baseline is the context aggrega-
tion network (CAN) (Zhang, Ng, and Chen 2018) that is de-
signed for image processing and reﬂection removal. It has
a poor performance on the shadow removal task both on
shadow and non-shadow regions. However, our feature layer
aggregation (+ LA) technique greatly improves the qual-
ity of the shadow regions. This is because the hierarchical
mixed features will force the network to better understand
multiple contexts. Then, when training using the dual ag-
gregation network with attention aggregation (+DLA), our

that, the shadow generator in Mask-ShadowGAN is just an
auxiliary helper for unpaired shadow removal, other than
synthesizing the paired dataset for supervised learning as
data augmentation. The ShadowGAN trains using only the
low-resolution images from the computer rendered dataset.
For comparison, we train our shadow synthesis network and
others on the ISTD training set and test by synthesizing the
shadow images using the ISTD test set. We evaluate the re-
sults using the SSIM and PSNR. In addition, since percep-
tual quality is also important for image generation, we evalu-
ate the generated shadow using the image perceptual quality
metrics LPIPS (Zhang et al. 2018). As shown in Table. 4,
our method outperforms other methods in all the metrics.
Extend to Novel Domain Training using our synthesized
dataset enlarges the capabilities of the network. Here, we
show the potential of our methods in novel scenes. Par-
ticularly, we test the pre-trained ISTD model on the SRD
and SBU datasets without retraining on their speciﬁc train-
ing datasets. We show an examples from shadow detection
datasets SBU in Figure. 9. With the help of the synthesized
dataset (ISTD+S in Figure. 9), our network can better un-
derstand the scenes and remove the shadows in these regions
without ghosts or color inconsistencies. In the SRD dataset,
when training using the ISTD+S dataset, the RMSE of our
network is 9.82; however, if we train using only the ISTD
dataset, the RMSE is 11.9.

Conclusion

In this paper, we aim to create a ghost-free shadow removal
method in two aspects. First, we propose a novel network
that starts with context aggregation network and hierarchi-
cally aggregates the features and attentions. Our network
structure can produce high-quality border-free results from
multi-context features and attentions. Then, to enlarge the
scenes in the current shadow removal dataset and reduce
the color inconsistencies, we train a shadow matting GAN
to synthesize the shadow images from the corresponding
shadow-free images and masks. The proposed shadow gen-
erator is used to augment the data of the current dataset. Ex-

Figure 7: Ablation study on our network structure. We plot
the results of our full methods with the input in yellow re-
gion. The baseline network CAN can remove the shadow but
still have color in-consistency, and our feature LA(+LA) and
dual LA(+DLA) can further remove the artifacts.

tion. We show the results and corresponding attention map.
It is obviously that gated attention learns the feature locally

method gains far better results with the supervision of the
shadow mask. In addition, we ﬁnd that the local gated con-
volution (Yu et al. 2019) is quantitatively less effective on
our task. Here, we plot an example in Figure. 8 and compare
our attention with the results on local gated convolution. We
visualize the mean responses on the last attention features
after S igmoid. The ﬁgure shows that when the shadow re-
gion is large enough, the local gated convolution only gains
the knowledge from its sibling convolution, causing the fail-
ure to capture the whole image context.

Comparison on Shadow Synthesis Since there are few

deep learning-based methods for shadow synthesis particu-
larly, we compare the auxiliary network for unpaired shadow
removal in the Mask-ShadowGAN (Hu et al. 2019) and the
ShadowGAN (Zhang, Liang, and Wang 2019), which syn-
thesizes shadows using the Pix2Pix (Isola et al. 2017). Note
