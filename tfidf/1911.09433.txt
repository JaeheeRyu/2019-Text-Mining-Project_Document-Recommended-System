Abstract—Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has become an
appealing solution for a wide range of commercial and civilian
applications because of its high mobility and ﬂexible deployment.
Due to the continuous UAV navigation, the channel between
UAV and base station (BS) is subject to the Doppler effect.
Meanwhile, when the BS is equipped with massive number
of antennas, the non-negligible propagation delay across the
array aperture would cause beam squint effect. In this paper,
we ﬁrst investigate the channel of UAV communications under
both Doppler shift effect and beam squint effect. Then, we
design a gridless compressed sensing (GCS) based channel
tracking method, where the high dimension uplink channel can
be derived by estimating a few physical parameters such as
the direction of arrival (DOA), Doppler shift, and the complex
gain information. Besides, with the Doppler shift reciprocity and
angular reciprocity, the downlink channel can be derived by only
one pilot symbol, which greatly decreases the downlink channel
training overhead. Various simulation results are provided to
verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Index Terms—UAV, massive MIMO, beam squint, time varying
channel, and channel tracking.

I . INTRODUCT ION

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has attracted ever increas-
ing attention from both the industry and the academia due to
its high mobility and ﬂexible deployment. UAVs have been
widely exploited in many applications such as the transporta-
tion of good, border surveillance, search and rescue missions
as well as disaster response, etc [1], [2]. Various UAV ap-
plications put forward exceptionally stringent communication
requirements along the lines of available data rate, connection
reliability, and latency, which promotes UAV communications
with massive array antennas under millimeter-wave (mmWave)
band (30GHz-300GHz) to enhance the system performance.
Different from the traditional low frequency bands (< 6GHz),
the mmWave has large available frequency resources that could
be directly transmitted into the system bandwidth and realize
broadband communications. Meanwhile, large antenna array
is capable of providing enormous spatial gain, which can be
utilized to overcome the large path loss of mmWave band [3]–
[5].
Different from the conventional cellular communications,
the majority of the UAV channel power would be contained
within the line of sight (LoS) path, which motivates a lot of

angle domain signal processing studies. The authors in [6]
formulated the dynamic massive MIMO channel as one sparse
signal model and developed an expectation maximization
(EM) based sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework to
learn the model parameters of the sparse channel. An angle
division multiple access (ADMA) based channel
tracking
method was proposed in [7] for massive MIMO systems,
where tracking the channel is simpliﬁed to tracking the direc-
tion of arrival (DOAs) of the incident signals. Meanwhile, the
uplink cooperative NOMA was investigated in [8] for cellular-
connected UAV, which exploits the existing backhaul links
among base stations to improve the throughput gains. The
authors in [9] proposed interference alignment and soft-space-
reuse based cooperative transmission for multi-cell massive
MIMO networks. The authors in [10] proposed an energy-
efﬁcient UAV communication strategy via optimizing the
UAV’s trajectory.
However, the channel of UAV communications with massive
array antenna exhibits several unique features compared to the
conventional MIMO system, which hardens the procedure of
channel tracking: (i) a practical channel of UAV communi-
cations would encounter Doppler shift due to the continuous
UAV navigation; (ii) as with massive MIMO conﬁguration,
there would be a non-negligible propagation delay across
the array aperture for the same data symbol, causing beam
squint effect in frequency domain. Recently, there do exist
some works [11] considering the static massive MIMO with
beam squint. However, channel tracking under both Doppler
shift effect and beam squint effect has not been investigated,
for UAV communication systems to the best of the authors’
knowledge.
In this paper, we ﬁrst model the UAV communications under
both Doppler shift effect and beam squint effect. Then, we
present an efﬁcient gridless compressed sensing (GCS) based
channel tracking method, where tracking the spatial channel is
converted to tracking the DOA of the incident signal, Doppler
shift, and complex gain respectively. Additionally, the down-
link channel can be derived by only one pilot symbol with
the Doppler shift and angular reciprocity. Various simulation
results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed
studies.

We consider multiple UAV communications with mmWave
massive MIMO, where the ground base station (BS)
is
equipped with the M B × 1 uniform linear array (ULA), and K
UAVs are separately equipped with M U × 1 ULA, as shown

Remark 1: To the best of the authors knowledge, this is
the ﬁrst work that presents the channel modeling of massive
MIMO system under both the Doppler shift effect and beam
squint effect for UAV communications.
For ease of illustration, we assume that each UAV is
equipped with M U = 1 antenna in the rest of this paper.
Then the continuous-time channel could be simpliﬁed as

Hk (t, f ) = αk e−j2πfd t a (θk , f ) ,

(12)

where θ is DOA of the incident signals at BS side.
The discrete-time channel at block l could be derived as

hk (l, f ) = αe−j2πfkd lNb Ts a (θk , f ) ,

(13)

where Nb is the number of symbols in each block.
Since the UAV speed and physical location would change
much slower than the channel variation, the UAV movement
related parameters such as fkd and θk can be viewed as
unchanged within tens of blocks. Therefore, we can stack
channels of L blocks into an LM × 1 vector hk (f ) and obtain

hk (f ) = αk vec (cid:2)a (θk , f ) bH (fkd )(cid:3)
= αk p (fkd , θk , f ) ,

(14)

where b (fkd ) = (cid:2)1, e−j2πfkdNbTs , . . . , e−j2πfkd (L−1)NbTs (cid:3)

can be deemed as the Doppler steering vector.
Interestingly, even for LoS scenario, the large array would
still lead to the inter symbol interference (ISI) due to the
propagation delays of the symbols across the large antenna
array, which is a signiﬁcantly different phenomenon from the
conventional case.
Let us apply orthogonal frequency division multiplex-
ing (OFDM) to remove ISI. Denote η = W
N as the carrier
interval, where W is the system bandwidth and N is the
number of the carriers. According to Equ. (14), the channel at
the (p + 1)-th carrier can be expressed as

hk ((p + 1)η) = αp (fkd , θk , pη) .

(15)

Since the channel model is signiﬁcant for the subsequent
channel tracking, precoding, and transmission, we here provide
an explicit classiﬁcation rule to determine the channel model
type for UAV communications: nonselective, time selective,
antenna selective or doubly selective.1 According to (9),
the antenna selective effect would not exist, when the total
time delay of the signal across the massive array meets
≪ 1. Therefore,
the classiﬁcation rule can be readily derived as

≪ Ts , namely, (M −1)d sin θk

(16)

Meanwhile, there would exist time selective effect when
fd maxTs ≪ 1, and otherwise not. Therefore, the integrated
channel classiﬁcation rule can be seen in Tab. I.

1 Doubly selectivity here means antenna selectivity plus time selectivity.

Theorem 1: Under the condition M B → ∞ and L → ∞,
the channels hk ((p + 1)η) in Equ. (14) are progressively
orthogonal for UAV communications with mmWave massive
array antenna when UAVs have distinct DOAs or velocities.
Proof 1: When M B → ∞ and L → ∞, the relationship
between hH
1 ((p + 1)η) and h2 ((p + 1)η) meets (17), which is
shown on the top of the next page. Moreover, ξk is given by

ξk = (cid:20) d (sin θ1 − sin θ2 )
λc

(17)

Therefore, the channels hk ((p + 1)η) in Equ. (14) are
progressively orthogonal for UAV communications when the
UAVs have distinct DOAs or velocities.
According to Theorem 1, the sparse characteristic of UAV
communications with mmWave massive array antenna makes
it possible to schedule users according to the channel DOA
or velocity information. As is vividly shown in Fig. 3, the
users with different DOA or velocity could be simultaneously
scheduled. The corresponding user scheduling scheme can be
named as angle division multiple access (ADMA) and velocity
division multiple access (VDMA).

I I I . CHANNE L TRACK ING STRAT EGY

The beam squint effect makes the traditional channel trans-
mission strategy inapplicable for UAV communications with
mmWave massive array antenna. In this section, we will
provide a GCS based channel
tracking method for UAV
communications with mmWave massive array antenna.

A. Uplink Channel Tracking

We here utilize the comb-type pilot channel estimation
to track the time-varying channel. Let us assume P of Nc
subcarriers are exploited as pilots, and the corresponding
subcarrier index set for user k is Pk = {pk,1 , . . . , pk,P }. Then,
the channel of user k in these pilot subcarrier can be stacked
into a matrix as

Hk = αk [p (fkd , θk , 0) , . . . , p (fkd , θk , (P − 1)η)]
= P (θk , fkd ) αk .

(19)

Assuming that all users send pilot symbol “1” over the
selected sub-carriers while transmitting data symbols over
other sub-carriers. Then, the received uplink pilots from the
M antennas and P subcarriers over L blocks can be derived
as

By exploiting the maximization-minimization (MM) itera-

The last inequality in (27) results from the convexity of
−J0 (α), and the equality will be attained only when α(n) =
α. Therefore, at the (n + 1)-th iteration, it will hold that
S0 (cid:16)α|α(n) (cid:17) − J0 (α) ≥ S0 (cid:16)α(n) |α(n) (cid:17) − J0 (α(n) ). (28)

Equ.
(31) means that decreasing the surrogate func-
tion Sλ (cid:0)θ , fd , α|α(n) (cid:1) indeed decreases Jλ (θ , fd , α), which
guarantees the effectiveness of optimizing (29). There-
fore, we only need to minimize the surrogate function
Sλ (cid:0)θ , fd , α|α(n) (cid:1). Then, for the given θ and fd , the optimal
value of α can be immediately derived as

The concrete steps of the proposed algorithm are displayed
in Alg. 1. Since the dictionary of the GCS approach is not
pre-deﬁned, which remains unknown in the process of the
parameter estimation, the proposed channel tracking method
overcomes the performance degradation of the traditional on-
grid CS methods due to the grid mismatch.

which is called angular reciprocity. The angular reciprocity
holds true at the case that the frequency interval between the
uplink and downlink channel is within several GHz.
Meanwhile, since the relative velocity of the uplink and
downlink channel are the same, the downlink Doppler shift
can also be derived from the uplink one, which can be name
as Doppler shift reciprocity. We denote the downlink channel
carrier frequency and its corresponding carrier wavelength as
c and λD
c . With the uplink Doppler shift fkd , the downlink
one can be derived as

f D

f D

kd = fkd

c

f D

.

(48)

Then, with both the angular and Doppler shift reciprocity,
the downlink channel over all the sub-carriers can be formu-
lated as

kd , θD

kd (cid:1)(cid:3)

k , f (cid:1) bH (cid:0)f D
k , f (cid:1) .

k vec (cid:2)a (cid:0)θD
2) Downlink Channel Tracking: According to (49), the only
unknown parameter in the downlink channel gk (f ) is the
complex gain αD
k . Therefore, we only need to estimate αD
to track the total downlink channel.
Denote the beamforming vector for user k of the n-th sub-
carrier as

(49)

k

gk (n) = (cid:2)aD (cid:0)θD
k , n(cid:1)(cid:3)H

and then overall beamforming matrix at BS can be expressed
as

gD (n) =

KiXk=1

gk (n),

(51)

B. Downlink Channel Tracking with the Angular and Doppler
Shift Reciprocity

1) Downlink Channel Representation: According to [17],
[18], the physical DOAs θk are approximately identical for
the uplink and downlink channel transmission, namely,

θD
k = θk ,

(47)

where the beamforming vector gD (n) says that BS formulate
beams towards DOA of the scheduled UAVs.
Denote s as the training symbol, and then we select the sub-
carrier n for downlink channel tracking. The angle domain
sparse channels permit UAVs with different DOAs to be
trained by the same pilot sequence, and therefore the same
one pilot symbol s can be simultaneous utilized to decrease
the training overhead.

The received signal of the p-th UAV at the n-th sub-carrier
can be expressed as

while the downlink channel can be reconstructed as
k vec ha (cid:16) ˆθD
With both the angle reciprocity and Doppler shift reci-
procity, the unknown estimated coefﬁcient of each scheduled
UAV at
the downlink channel training period is only the
complex gain, which greatly decreases the training overhead.
Besides, since the beamforming is executed at BS, there is no
necessity for the scheduled UAVs to know the Doppler and
angle signature of themselves. In this way, the feedback cost
is greatly decreased for UAV communications.

˜hk (l, (p + 1)η) = FH hk (l, (p + 1)η),

(56)
where F is the normalized M B × M B IDFT matrix with
M rq /√M B . On the basis of (56), the q -th element
[F]rq = ej 2π
of ˜hk (l, (p + 1)η) can be derived as (57), which is shown on
the top of the next page.
When M B is large, there always exists q meeting
= 0 for the given p and θk . In this case,
all the channel power is concentrated on this point p, which
is given by

Algorithm 2 : DOA Tracking Algorithm

as ˆθk (1) = [θk (1), 0], κ(1) = 0;

∂θk (l−1) = φ.

• Step 2: Compute the Jacobi matrix for the system equa-
tion: φk (l − 1) = ∂ [ψθk (l−1)]
• Step 3: Compute the Jacobi matrix for the measurement
equation: According to (57), we can derive the elements
of the Jacobi matrix corresponding to the p + 1-th
sub-carrier as ̟kp (l − 1) = dM
fc (cid:17) , and the Jacobi matrix can
be stacked from ̟kp (l − 1) as ̟k (l − 1).
• Step 4: Prediction of the system states: θk (l|l − 1) =
• Step 5: Minimize the predicted mean square error (MSE):

λ cos ¯θk (l − 1) (cid:16)1 + pη
φθk (l − 1);
κ(l|l − 1) = φk (l − 1)κ(l − 1)φk (l − 1)H + Qωk ;

• Step 8: Compute minimum mean square error (MMSE):

λ

κ(l) = [I − Υ(l)̟k (l)]κ(l|l − 1);

• Step 9: Go to next block l + 1.

Denote Ψk (l) = [θk (l), ˙θk (l)] as the system states of DOA
Tracking, where θk (l) and ˙θk (l) represent DOA and angular
rate of user k in block l respectively. Then, the kinematic
model can be applied to characterize the variation of DOA as
[19]

Ψk (l) = ΦΨk (l − 1) + ωk (l)
= (cid:20)1 N Ts
1 (cid:21) Ψk (l − 1) + ωk (l),

E[ωk (m)ωH

where ωk (m)
is
the
system noise
that meets
k (m)] = Qωk , and (60) can be named as
the system equation for DOA tracking.
According to (60) and (59), the DOA tracking procedure
is a typical nonlinear system. In this case, extended Kalman
ﬁlter (EKF) would serve as a common approach for DOA
tracking, and the detailed steps are illustrated in Alg. 2.
According to Alg. 2, the DOA can be realtimely tracked
by the Kalman ﬁlter based predicting and updating. Channel
tracking is transmitted to tracking the Doppler information and
complex gain information, which decreases the training over-
head. The whole channel tracking procedure is concluded in
Fig. 4. For clarity, we summarize channel tracking procedure:
• Uplink DOA, Doppler shift, and complex gain tracking;
• Uplink channel reconstruction;
• Downlink DOA and Doppler derivation with angle and
Doppler shift reciprocity;
• Downlink complex gain tracking;
• Downlink channel reconstruction.

We ﬁrst investigate the performance of the proposed GCS
based parameter estimation method in Fig. 5. The performance
metric is the normalized mean square error (MSE). It can be
found that with the increase of the signal to noise ratio (SNR),
MSEs of the complex gain, the Doppler shift, and DOA all
decrease. Besides, we see that there are error ﬂoors of the
estimated parameter due to the limited iteration step in Alg. 1.
Next, we investigate the performance of the proposed chan-
nel tracking method over SNR in Fig. 6, where the antenna
number is set as M = 16, 32, and 128 respectively. It can be
seen that the MSEs of the proposed GCS based channel track-

ing methods decreases with the increase of SNR. Besides, with
the increase of the antennas, the performance of the proposed
method is enhanced, since much more antennas would bring
much more spatial gain. Moreover, the conventional channel
tracking method that ignores the beam squint effect would
not work for UAV communications with large antenna array,
which veriﬁes the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Then, we investigate the DOA tracking performance over
the time in Fig. 7, where the DFT searching method, the
method in [10], and the true DOA are also displayed for
comparison. It can be seen that the tendencies of all
the
displayed methods are consisted with the true DOA since

derived by estimating DOA, Doppler shift, and complex gain
information of the incident signal, respectively. The gridless
compressed sensing method was exploited to track the channel
parameters of UAV communications with massive antenna
array. Finally, we provided various simulation results to verify
the effectiveness of the proposed method over the existing
ones.

the DFT of the channel could reﬂect the DOA distribution of
the scheduled users. Besides, both the DFT searching method
and the proposed method are superior to the method in [10],
which neglects the beam squint effect. The performance of
the proposed method is much better than the DFT searching
method. The reason is that the proposed method and the DFT
searching method all take the antenna selective effect into
consideration, and the performance of the proposed method
is further enhanced by the Kalman ﬁlter.

In this paper, we investigated UAV communications with
mmWave massive array antenna. First, we explored the UAV
