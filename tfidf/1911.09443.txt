Abstract

A communication link aided by a Reconﬁgurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is studied, in which

the transmitter can control the state of the RIS via a ﬁnite-rate control link. Prior work mostly

assumed a ﬁxed RIS conﬁguration irrespective of the transmitted information. In contrast, this work

derives information-theoretic limits, and demonstrates that the capacity is achieved by a scheme that

jointly encodes information in the transmitted signal as well as in the RIS conﬁguration. In addition,

a novel signaling strategy based on layered encoding is proposed that enables practical successive

cancellation-type decoding at the receiver. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the standard

max-SNR scheme that ﬁxes the conﬁguration of the RIS as to maximize the Signal-to-Noise Ratio

(SNR) at the receiver is strictly suboptimal, and is outperformed by the proposed strategies at all

practical SNR levels.

I . INTRODUCT ION

A Reconﬁgurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) acts as an “anomalous mirror” that can be

conﬁgured to reﬂect impinging radio waves towards arbitrary angles, to apply phase shifts,

and to modify polarization [1]. Due to these desirable properties, RISs are being considered

for future wireless networks as means to shape the wireless propagation channel for signal,

interference, security, and scattering engineering [1]–[6].

Most prior work, to be reviewed below, proposed to use the RIS as a passive beamformer

in order to improve the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at the receivers. In contrast, this

paper takes a more fundamental information-theoretic perspective on the design of RIS-aided

communication links in which the transmitter can control the state of the RIS via a ﬁnite-rate

control link (see Fig. 1). The analysis points to a novel approach of signal engineering via

RISs that goes beyond the maximization of the SNR through an information-driven control

of the RIS: Rather than being ﬁxed to enhance the SNR, the RIS conﬁguration is jointly

encoded with the transmitted signals as a function of the information message.

Related Work: Based on the electromagnetic and physical properties of RISs, free-space

path loss models for RIS-aided systems were developed in [7] and [8]. The optimization of a

ﬁxed RIS conﬁguration has been studied in various scenarios [9]–[22]. We mention here some

representative examples. Algorithms for jointly optimizing precoding at the transmitter and

beamforming at the RIS were proposed for a point-to-point Multiple-Input Single-Output

(MISO) systems in [9], and for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems in [10],

[11]. RIS-based passive beamforming was compared to conventional relaying methods such

as amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward in [12], [13], and to multi-antenna systems

in [14]. Algorithms for maximizing weighted sum-rate and energy efﬁciency in an RIS-aided

multi-user MISO systems were proposed in [15] and [16], [17], respectively. A multi-group

multi-cast RIS-aided system was studied in [18], and efﬁcient algorithms were proposed to

maximize the sum-rate achieved by all groups.

To the best of our knowledge, the only paper that considers joint encoding of the transmitted

signal and RIS state is [23], in which the receiver antenna for which SNR is maximized

encodes the information bits using index modulation [24]. However, reference [23] does not

address the optimality of the proposed index modulation scheme. Moreover, the proposed

scheme ﬁxes the conﬁguration of the RIS for the entire duration of the transmission, and

hence it provides minor rate increments for large coding blocks.

Main Contributions: In this paper, we study the RIS-aided system with a single-antenna

transmitter and a receiver with N antennas illustrated in Fig. 1. We ﬁrst derive the capacity

of the system for any RIS control rate, and prove that joint encoding of transmitted signals

and RIS conﬁguration is generally necessary to achieve the maximum information rate. In

addition, we explicitly characterize the performance gain of joint encoding in the high-SNR

regime. Then, we propose an achievable scheme based on layered encoding and Successive

Cancellation Decoding (SCD) that enable information encoding in the RIS conﬁguration,

while supporting standard separate encoding and decoding strategies. Numerical experiments

demonstrate that, for SNR levels of practical interest, capacity-achieving joint encoding

provides signiﬁcant gain over the max-SNR approach.

Illustration of the network under study consisting of a single-antenna transmitter (TX), a receiver (RX) with N

jointly encodes a message w into a codeword of n symbols, sent on the wireless link, and a control action (once every m

symbols), sent on the control link to the RIS.

Notation: For any positive integer K , we deﬁne the set [K ] , {1, 2, . . . , K }. For any real
number γ , we deﬁne (γ )+ , max{0, γ }. The cardinality of a set A is denoted as |A | . The
ℓ2 -norm of a vector z is denoted as k z k and the Frobenius norm of a matrix Z is denoted as
kZ kF . diag(x) represents a diagonal matrix with diagonal given by vector x.

I I . SY STEM MODEL

We consider the system depicted in Fig. 1 in which a Reconﬁgurable Intelligent Surface

(RIS) of K elements is leveraged by a single-antenna transmitter for the purpose of enhancing

its communication with a receiver equipped with N antennas over a quasi-static fading
channel. A coding block consists of n symbols taken from a constellation B of B = |B |
points, and is used to communicate a message w ∈ [1, . . . , 2n R ] of nR bits with rate R
[bits/symbol]. Unlike most prior work, the transmitter encodes message w , not only into

the codeword of n symbols sent on the wireless link to the receiver, but also jointly in the

conﬁguration of the RIS. The latter is deﬁned by the phase shifts that each of the K RIS

elements applies to the impinging wireless signal.

Following [3], we assume that the phase shift applied by each element is chosen from a
ﬁnite set A of A = |A | > 0 distinct hardware-determined values. Moreover, there is a limit on
the rate at which the RIS can be controlled, such that the phase shifts θθθ (t ) are ﬁxed for blocks
of m > 0 consecutive transmitted symbols. That is, as illustrated in Fig. 1, the state θθθ (t ) of
the RIS can be changed only at the beginning of each block t ∈ [n/m] of m transmitted

4

symbols. Note that if m = n, the conﬁguration of the RIS is ﬁxed for the entire duration of

the transmission as assumed in the prior work reviewed above. We take n to be a multiple

of m.

We assume that the direct link between transmitter and receiver is blocked, as in, e.g., [14],

so that propagation from transmitter to receiver occurs through reﬂection from the RIS. Let
the received signal matrix Y(t ) = (y1 (t ), . . . , ym (t )) ∈ ƒN ×m collect the received samples in
the t th block of a codeword, so that column yi (t ), i ∈ [m], denotes the signal received at the
N antennas for the i th transmitted symbol in the block. The signal received on the wireless
link within each t th block, with t ∈ [n/m], can then be written as

Y(t ) = HS(t )gx(t ) + Z(t ),

(1)

where the transmitted signal x(t ) = ( x1 (t ), . . . , xm (t )) ∈ B1×m consists of the m symbols
transmitted in the t th block; the channel vector g ∈ ƒK ×1 denotes the quasi-static ﬂat-fading
channel from the transmitter to the RIS; the RIS conﬁguration matrix

S(t ) = diag (cid:16)e j θ 1 (t ), . . . , e j θK (t ) (cid:17)

(2)

denotes the phase shifts applied by the RIS during the transmission of the t th block, with
θ k (t ) ∈ A denoting the phase-shift for the k th RIS element, k ∈ [K ]; the channel matrix H ∈
ƒN ×K denotes the quasi-static ﬂat-fading channel from the RIS to the N receiver antennas; and
the white Gaussian noise matrix Z(t ) ∈ ƒN ×m , whose elements are independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) as CN(0, 1), denotes the additive noise at the receiving antennas during
the transmission of the t th block. The transmitted signal is subject to the power constraint
…[ | xi (t ) | 2 ] ≤ P for i ∈ [m] and some P > 0. We assume full Channel State Information
(CSI) in the sense that the transmitter and receiver know the quasi-static channel vectors g

and H, which remain ﬁxed throughout the n symbols corresponding to the transmission of a

message w .
Based on the message w and CSI given by the pair (g, H), the encoder jointly selects
a codeword x(t ), as well as a sequence θθθ (t ) = (θ 1 (t ), . . . , θ K (t )) of RIS conﬁgurations, for
t ∈ [n/m]. Having received signal Y(t ) in (1) for t ∈ [n/m], the decoder produces the estimate
ˆw = ˆw (Y(1), . . . , Y(n/m), g, H) using knowledge of the CSI. As in the conventional deﬁnition
in information theory (see, e.g., [25, Ch. 7]), a rate R(g, H) is said to be achievable if the
probability of error satisﬁes the limit Pr( ˆw , w) → 0 when the codeword length grows
large, i.e., n → ∞. The corresponding capacity C (g, H) is deﬁned as the maximum over all
achievable rates, i.e.,

C (g, H) , sup{R(g, H) : R(g, H) is achievable},

(3)

5

where the supremum is taken over all joint encoding and decoding schemes. Finally, we

deﬁne the average rate and capacity as

R , …[R(g, H)] and C , …[C (g, H)],
where the average is taken over the distribution of the CSI (g, H).

(4)

I I I . JO INT ENCOD ING : CHANNEL CA PAC ITY

In this section, we derive the capacity C (g, H) and we argue that the standard max-SNR
method that does not encode information in the RIS conﬁguration (see, e.g., [9]–[22]) is

strictly suboptimal.

Proposition 1: The capacity of the channel (1) is given as

C (g, H) = −N log2 (e) −

the expectation in (5) being taken with respect to a matrix Z whose elements are i.i.d. as

(6)

CN(0, 1).

Proof: See Appendix A.

At a computational level, problem (5) is convex (see Appendix A), and hence it can

be solved using standard tools. In terms of the operational signiﬁcance of Proposition 1,

achieving capacity (5) generally requires joint encoding over codeword symbols x and RIS

conﬁguration variables θθθ , as well as joint decoding of message w based on information

encoded over both x and θθθ at the receiver. This is reﬂected in (5) in the optimization over
the joint distribution p(x, θθθ ). In the next section, we will consider a suboptimal approach that
uses separate encoding and decoding over x and θθθ through layering.

The following proposition derives achievable rates for the standard max-SNR approach

[9]–[22], whereby the state of the RIS θθθ is ﬁxed for the entire transmission, irrespective of

message w , so as to maximize the SNR at the receiver.

Proposition 2: The rate

Rmax-SNR(g, H) = −N log2 (e) − min

is achievable by selecting the phase shift vector θθθ so as to maximize SNR at the receiver,

where we have deﬁned function

fmax-SNR( x, θθθ, z) , log2 x ′ ∈B

p( x ′) exp (cid:16)− k z + HSg( x − x ′) k 2 (cid:17) ! ,

and the expectation in (7) is taken with respect to z ∼ CN(0, IN ).
Proof: See Appendix B.

(8)

The max-SNR rate (7) can be again computed using convex optimization tools. It is

generally smaller than the counterpart capacity (5), and we will evaluate the corresponding

performance loss in Sec. V via numerical experiments. The following proposition settles the

comparison in the high-SNR regime.

Proposition 3: For any ﬁnite input constellation B, the high-SNR limit of the average

capacity is given as

where we have deﬁned the set

containing all possible distinct conﬁgurations of the matrix C = (e j θ 1 , . . . , e j θK )⊺x. Further-
more, for a given cardinality B = |B | of the constellation, the limit (9) is maximized for the
Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) constellation

B = { β, 3 β, . . . , (2B − 1) β },

where the factor β , p3P/[3 + 4(B2 − 1)] ensures average power P , yielding the limit

(11)

(12)

Proof: See Appendix C.
In the high-SNR regime, the rate of the max-SNR scheme is limited to log2 (B). Therefore,
Proposition 3 demonstrates that, for any RIS conﬁguration set A of A distinct phases, in

the high-SNR regime, modulating the RIS state can be used to increase the achievable rate
by K log2 ( A)/m bits per symbol as compared to the max-SNR scheme. Furthermore, the
proposition shows that, in this regime, it is optimal to use the ASK modulation (11), and

it implies that choosing independent codebooks for input x and RIS conﬁguration θθθ , i.e.,
setting p(x, θθθ ) = p(x)p(θθθ ) in (5), does not cause any performance loss at high SNR. As
an additional comparison, we note that the high-SNR performance of the index modulation
scheme proposed in [23] is upper-bounded by log2 (B)+log2 (N )/n. Therefore, its suboptimality
as compared to (12) increases with the ratio n/m.

IV. LAYERED ENCOD ING

As discussed, achieving the capacity (5) requires jointly encoding the message over the

phase shift vector θθθ and the transmitted signal x, while performing optimal, i.e., maximum-

likelihood joint decoding at the receiver. In this section we propose a strategy based on layered

encoding and Successive Cancellation Decoding (SCD) that uses only standard separate

encoding and decoding strategies, while still beneﬁting from the modulation of information

over the state of the RIS to improve over the max-SNR approach.

To this end, the message w is split into two sub-messages, or layers, w1 and w2 , such that

w1 , of rate R1 , is encoded by the phase shift vector θθθ , whereas w2 , of rate R2 , is encoded
by the transmitted signal x = ( x1, . . . , xm ). In order to enable decoding using standard SCD,
the ﬁrst τ symbols x1, . . . , xτ , with τ ≥ 1, in vector x are ﬁxed and used as pilots. The
receiver starts by decoding w1 using the ﬁrst τ vectors y1, . . . , yτ , in every received block
Y = (y1, . . . , ym ). This allows the decoder to obtain vector θθθ , which is then used to decode
w2 . This strategy achieves the rate detailed in Proposition 4.

The expectations in (14) and (16) are taken with respect to random vector z ∼ CN(0, IN ).
Proof: Rate R1 (g, H, τ) is obtained by modulating the RIS phases, and follows in a
manner similar to [26, Eq. (4)]. Rate R2 (g, H) is instead obtained by applying “water-ﬁlling”
power allocation [27]. Details can be found in Appendix D.

V. NUMER ICAL RESULTS

In this section, we provide numerical examples with the main aim of comparing the

capacity (5) with the rate (7) achieved by the max-SNR approach and the rate (13) of the

layered-encoding strategy. For the set of RIS conﬁgurations, we assume A uniformly spaced
phases in the set A , {0, 2π/ A, . . . , 2π ( A − 1)/ A}, whereas, for the input constellation, we
consider ASK and Phase Shift Keying (PSK). All rates are averaged over the channel vector
g ∼ CN(0, IK ) and channel matrix H whose elements are i.i.d. as CN(0, 1) and independent
of g.

In Fig. 2 we plot the average rate as a function of the average power P , with N = 2

receiver antennas, K = 3 RIS elements, A = 2 available phase shifts, a symbol-to-RIS
√P, ±i√P } or 4-ASK
control rate m = 2, and input constellation given by QPSK B = {±
B = { β, 3 β, 5 β, 7 β } with β = pP/21. For layered coding, we set τ = 1 pilot, which was
seem to maximize the rate in this experiment. For very low SNR, i.e., less than −20dB, it
is observed that the max-SNR approach is close to being optimal, and hence, in this regime,

encoding information in the RIS conﬁguration does not increase the rate. For larger SNR

levels of practical interest, however, joint encoding provides signiﬁcant gain over the max-

SNR scheme and the layered approach proposed in Sec. IV, with the latter in turn strictly

improving over the max-SNR scheme. In this regard, we note that we have numerically
veriﬁed that, in this regime, the optimal joint distribution p(x, θθθ ) in (5) is not a product
distribution except for very large SNR levels (see discussion after Proposition 3). Finally,

while PSK outperforms ASK when used with the max-SNR and layered-encoding schemes,

the opposite is true with joint encoding in the high-SNR regime. In fact, as discussed in

Proposition 3, in the high-SNR regime, out of all ﬁnite input sets B with the same size, ASK

achieves the maximum capacity.

The gain of using the state of the RIS as a medium for conveying information is expected

to decrease as the rate of the control link from transmitter to RIS decreases. This is illustrated

Note that the performance of the layered-encoding scheme is identical for m = 1 and m = 2

due to the use of the pilot symbol, as described in Sec. IV. It is observed that, while, for

m = 1, joint encoding achieves three times the rate of max-SNR, the gain reduces to a factor

of 1.3 for m = 7.

V I . CONCLU S ION S

In this work, we have studied the capacity of a Reconﬁgurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-

aided channel. Focusing on a fundamental model with one transmitter and one receiver, the

common approach of using the RIS as a passive beamformer to maximize the SNR at the

receiver was shown to be generally suboptimal in terms of the achievable rate for ﬁnite

input constellations. Instead, the capacity-achieving scheme was proved to jointly encode

information in the RIS conﬁguration as well as in the transmitted signal. In addition, a

suboptimal, yet practical, strategy based on layered encoding and successive cancellation

decoding was demonstrated to outperform passive beamforming for sufﬁciently high SNR

levels.

Among related open problems, we mention the design of low-complexity joint encoding

and decoding strategies that approach capacity, the derivation of the capacity for channels

with imperfect a priori CSI [28]–[30] or noisy RIS [31], and extensions to RIS systems with

multiple users/surfaces [1], [15], [16], [18] or with security constraints [32]–[34].

A. Proof of Proposition 1

APPEND IX

The model (1) can be viewed as a standard channel with input (x, θθθ ) and output Y. This is
because the transmitter directly controls the states of the RIS S(t ) for t ∈ [n/m]. Therefore,
it follows from the channel coding theorem [25, Ch. 7] that the capacity can be expressed as

C (g, H) = max

p(x,θθθ ):
…[ | xi | 2 ]≤P,
x∈Bm, θθθ ∈AK

1
m [h(Y) − h(Y |x, θθθ )] .

(21)

Since the conditional probability density function of the output Y given the input (x, θθθ ) is
(22)

e− kY−HSgx k2

F ,

1

p(Y |x, θθθ ) =

π N m

we have h(Y |x, θθθ ) = mN log2 (π e) and the differential entropy h(Y) can be written as (see,
e.g., [35, Eq. (3)] and [26, Eq. (4)])

h(Y) = mN log2 (π ) − x∈Bm θθθ ∈AK

e− kZ k 2

F fc (x, θθθ, Z) dZ,

(23)

where the function fc (x, θθθ, Z) is deﬁned in (6). Note that the differential entropy h(Y) is a
concave function of p(x, θθθ ) for ﬁxed p(Y |x, θθθ ) [25, Theorem 2.7.4], Therefore, problem (21)
can be solved using standard tools.

B. Proof of Proposition 2

Fix a phase shift vector θθθ and an input distribution p( x ). Since the state of the RIS is
constant for the entire transmission, the channel (1) can be restated as

y(t ) = HSg x (t ) + z(t ),

(24)

11

where z(t ) ∼ CN(0, IN ). For this channel, by [25, Ch. 7], the following rate is achievable
(25)

R(g, H) = I ( x ; y) = h(y) − N log2 (π e),

where, similar to the proof of Proposition 1, the differential entropy h(y) can be expressed
as

h(y) = N log2 (π ) − x ∈B

p( x )… [ fmax-SNR ( x, θθθ, z)] ,

with the function fmax-SNR( x, θθθ, z) deﬁned in (8).

C. Proof of Proposition 3

In the high-SNR regime, we can obtain the limit

I (x, θθθ ; Y) = I (C; Y) −−−−→P→∞

H (C) ≤ log2 |C |,

where equality is achieved for a uniform input distribution p(x, θθθ ).

D. Proof of Proposition 4

(26)

(27)

The transmitted message w is divided into two layers w1 and w2 that are encoded in the
phase shift vector θθθ (t ) and the transmitted signal x(t ), respectively, for t ∈ [n/m]. Let yi (t )
denote the i th column of the received signal matrix Y(t ) (1), i ∈ [m], which can be expressed
as

yi (t ) = H diag (cid:16)e j θ 1 (t ), . . . , e j θK (t ) (cid:17) g xi (t ) + zi (t ),

The channel (29) is equivalent to a point-to-point Gaussian MIMO channel with PSK input
and an average power constraint of P in which a precoder given by diag(g) is applied, and
the noise at each receiving antenna has variance 1/τ . Therefore, it follows from [26, Eq. (4)]
that a rate of R1 (g, H, τ)/ ˜m is achievable for layer w1 . The factor ˜m = max{τ + 1, m} is due
to the fact that this scheme requires a transmitted block of size greater than τ in order to
encode w2 in the symbols of x(t ) excluding the ﬁrst τ symbols.

Once the receiver decodes the ﬁrst layer w1 , it knows the state of the RIS S(t ) for all
t ∈ [n/m]. Therefore, the i t h column of the received signal matrix, for i ≥ τ + 1, can be
written as

yi (t ) = HS(t )g xi (t ) = ˜g(t ) xi (t ),

i = τ + 1, . . . , ˜m,

(30)

with time-varying channel vector g(t ) , HS(t )g, which is known to both transmitter and
receiver. The channel (30) is equivalent to a fast-fading model with CSI at the transmitter

and receiver [27]. Therefore, the following scheme is applied. The transmitter uses a uniform
input distribution, i.e., p( x ) = 1/ |B | for all x ∈ B. For an RIS conﬁguration θθθ , the transmitter
ampliﬁes the transmitted symbol by α(θθθ ) in (18). Note that the average-power constraint is
satisﬁed due to equality (20). Hence, a rate of I ( x ; y |θθθ )/m can be achieved, where, similar
to the proofs of Proposition 1 and Proposition 2, the mutual information I ( x ; y |θθθ ) can be
expressed as R2 (g, H) in (16). Since ˜m − τ of the ˜m symbols in block x(t ) are used for
conveying information, the total rate achieved in the second layer is ( ˜m − τ)R2 (g, H)/ ˜m. Thus,
using both layers, the rate Rlayered (g, H, τ) in (13) is achievable.
