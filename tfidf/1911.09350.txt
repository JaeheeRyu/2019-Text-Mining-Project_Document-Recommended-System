Abstract

We construct a class of Z2Z4 -additive cyclic codes generated by pairs
of polynomials, study their algebraic structures, and obtain the generator
matrix of any code in the class. Using a probabilistic method, we prove
that, for any positive real number δ < 1/3 such that the entropy at 3δ/2
is less than 1/2, the probability that the relative minimal distance of a
random code in the class is greater than δ is almost 1; and the probability
that the rate of the random code equals to 1/3 is also almost 1. As an
obvious consequence, the Z2Z4 -additive cyclic codes are asymptotically
good.

MSC classes: 94B15, 94B25, 94B65.
Key words: Z2Z4 -additive cyclic code, relative minimum distance,
random code, asymptotically good code.

1 Introduction

A class of codes is said to be asymptotically good if there is a sequence C1 , C2 , · · ·
of codes in the class with length ni of Ci going to inﬁnity such that both the
rate of Ci and the relative minimum distance of Ci are positively bounded from
below. By a Varshamov’s probabilistic argument [24], linear codes over a ﬁnite
ﬁeld are asymptotically good.
Cyclic codes are an important class of codes and studied extensively. It is
a long-standing open question: are the cyclic codes asymptotically good? The
question was ﬁrst asked by Assmus, Mattson, and Turyn in 1966 (see [5]). Many
related researches are unfolded by revolving around the question, for example,
studies on asymptotic properties of quasi-cyclic codes, group codes, and so on. A
classical result is that the quasi-cyclic codes of index 2 are asymptotically good
(see [11], [12], [19]). Note that quasi-cyclic codes of index 1 are just cyclic codes.

Recently, [15] introduced quasi-cyclic codes of fractional index, and proved that
the quasi-cyclic codes of fractional index between 1 and 2 are asymptotically
good.
In 1994, Hammons et al. discovered that some good non-linear binary codes
can be viewed as the Gray map images of some linear codes over Z4 (see [17]).
From then on, the study of codes over Z4 and other ﬁnite rings has been develop-
ing. In particular, linear and cyclic codes over Z4 have been studied intensively
([3], [1], [2], [22]).
In 1973, Delsarte [13]) deﬁned additive codes as subgroups of the underlying
abelian groups in translation association schemes. For the binary Hamming
scheme, i.e., when the underlying abelian group is of order 2n , only the abelian
groups of the form Zα
4 with α+ 2β = n appear. The subgroups C of Zα
are called Z2Z4 -additive codes ([7], [9], [23]). If β = 0, then Z2Z4 -additive codes
are binary linear codes. If α = 0, then Z2Z4 -additive codes are the quaternary
linear codes over Z4 . So, this class of codes contains all binary and quaternary
linear codes as a subclass. Moreover, this class of codes has shown at its early
stage some promising applications. For example, perfect Z2Z4 -additive codes
have been utilized in the sub ject of steganography ([23]). Therefore, Z2Z4 -
additive codes are an important class of codes. In recent years, the structure
and properties of Z2Z4 -additive codes have been intensely studied (see [9]). In
[4], Abualrub, Siap and Aydin ﬁrst introduced Z2Z4 -additive cyclic codes. [10]
studied the generator matrices and dual codes of Z2Z4 -additive cyclic codes.
Borges, Dougherty, Fern´andez-C´ordoba and Ten-Valls study the rank and the
kernel of Z2Z4 -additive cyclic codes in [8].
An interesting question we are concerned with comes up: are the Z2Z4 -
additive cyclic codes asymptotically good?
In this paper we answer the question positively. A key innovation to solve the
question is that: within Z2Z4 -additive cyclic codes we ﬁnd a class of codes such
that the codes in the class possess good algebraic structures, in fact, they are
algebraically isomorphic to the binary quasi-cyclic codes of index two generated
by pairs of polynomials; and, though the algebraic isomorphism dos not preserve
the rates and the relative minimum distances of the codes, we have a technical
probabilistic method to determine asymptotically the rates and the relative
minimum distances of the codes in the class.
In Section 2, we state some preliminaries on Z2Z4 -additive codes and Z2Z4 -
additive cyclic codes. The rate R(C ) and the relative minimum distance ∆(C )
of a Z2Z4 -additive code C are also deﬁned in this section.
In Section 3, we construct the class of the Z2Z4 -additive cyclic codes Ca,b
(deﬁned below) which will play an important role as mentioned above, By Rm =
Z2 [X ]/hX m − 1i we denote the residue ring of the polynomial ring Z2 [X ] over
Z2 modulo the ideal hX m − 1i generated by X m − 1. And R′
m = Z4 [X ]/hX m − 1i
similarly. We deﬁne the Z2Z4 -additive cyclic codes with cycle length m to be
the R′
m -submodules of Rm × R′
m . With Z2Z4 as an alphabet, such codes has
many properties similar to the classical cyclic codes, e.g., they can be imple-
mented by feed-back shift registers. For our purpose, we are interested in the

2

R′
m -submodules of Rm × 2R′
m where 2R′
m is the ideal of R′
m generated by 2.
Furthermore, to ignore the trivial case, we consider the ideal Jm = hX − 1iRm
of Rm generated by X − 1, and the ideal 2J ′
m = h2(X − 1)iR′
m of R′
m gener-
ated by 2(X − 1). Then, for any polynomials a(X ), b(X ) ∈ Jm , we have an
R′
m -submodule Ca,b ⊆ Jm × 2J ′
Ca,b = (cid:8)(cid:0)c(X )a(X ), 2c(X )b(X )(cid:1) (cid:12)(cid:12) c(X ) ∈ Jm (cid:9). By investigating the two circu-
m generated by (a(X ), 2b(X )) in a natural way:
lant matrices associated with the two polynomials a(X ) and b(X ), we get the
generator matrix of Ca,b from the polynomial pair a(X ), b(X ). And we obtain
necessary information about the number of the ideals of Jm and their dimen-
sions for later using to estimate the relative minimum weight ∆(Ca,b ) and the
rate R(Ca,b ).
In Section 4, we view Jm × 2J ′
m as a probability space with equal probability
distribution, so that the Z2Z4 -additive cyclic codes Ca,b with cycle length m for
a(X ), b(X ) ∈ Jm is a random code, hence the relative minimum distance ∆(Ca,b )
and the rate R(Ca,b ) are random variables. We study the asymptotic properties
with m → ∞ of the two random variables. Given a real number δ such that 0 <
For each c(X ) ∈ Jm , the word (cid:0)c(X )a(X ), 2c(X )b(X )(cid:1) ∈ Ca,b is a random

codeword which gives a Bernoulli variable Yc : Yc = 1 if the random codeword
is a non-zero one with relative weight ≤ δ , and Yc = 0 otherwise. Applying [14,
Theorem 3.3] which estimates the number of the codewords in a code whose
relative weights are bounded from above, we calculate the expectation of Yc ;
and then we prove that the probability that ∆(Ca,b ) > δ is convergent to 1.
Next, using an asymptotic property of the dimensions of irreducible modules in
Jm , we prove that, in an asymptotic sense, the probability that R(Ca,b ) = 1
is also convergent to 1. Finally, it is an obvious consequence that Z2Z4 -additive
cyclic codes are asymptotically good.

2 Preliminaries

First of all, we sketch brieﬂy Z2Z4 -additive codes C . Any subgroup C of Zα
is called a Z2Z4 -additive code. It is obvious that Zα
4 is a Z4 -module, and
its subgroups are Z4 -submodules.
As usual, the weight of a = (a, a′ ) ∈ Zα

2 × Zβ

2 × Zβ
4

2 × Zβ

4 is deﬁned by

wt(a) = wt(a, a′ ) = wtH (a) + wtL (a′ ),

(2.1)

where wtH (a) is the Hamming weight of a and wtL (a′ ) is the Lee weight
of a′ . The minimum weight of the Z2Z4 -additive code C is deﬁned as wt(C ) =
min (cid:8)wt(c) (cid:12)(cid:12) c ∈ C \{0}(cid:9). For the well-known Gray map φ : Z4 → Z2
2 , φ(0) =
(0, 0), φ(1) = (0, 1), φ(2) = (1, 1), and φ(3) = (1, 0), there is a natural extension:
Φ : Zα

2 and a′ = (a′
0 , · · · , a′
4 . The
map Φ is an isometry which transforms the weight in Eqn (2.1) to the Hamming
weigh in Zn
2 . We call the fraction

∆(C ) =

(2.3)

the relative minimum distance of C .
Since C is a subgroup of Zα
4 , it is also isomorphic to an abelian structure
like Zγ
4 . Therefore, C is of type 2γ 4δ as a group, the number of elements
of C is |C | = 2γ+2δ , and the number of the elements of order 2 in C equals to
2γ+δ . We say that the fraction

is the rate of the code C .

There is an additive group homomorphism from Z2 into Z4 :

Z2 → Z4 , a 7→ 2a,

(2.4)

(2.5)

2 ×Zβ

and the image of the homomorphism is 2Z4 = {0, 2} ⊂ Z4 . With the help of this
homomorphism, the standard inner product in Zα
4 is deﬁned in [9] as follows:
for any a = (a0 , · · · , aα−1 , a′

Next, we introduce the deﬁnition of Z2Z4 -additive cyclic codes which is a
natural extension of the deﬁnition of classical cyclic codes.

Note that in the deﬁnition the length α of the Z2 -cycle and the length β of
the Z4 -cycle may be diﬀerent.
Denote Rα,β = Rα × R′

the polynomial ring Z2 [X ] modulo the ideal hX α − 1i generated by X α − 1, and

2 ×Zβ

This identiﬁcation gives a one-to-one correspondence between Zα
4 and Rα,β .
For f (X ) ∈ Z4 [X ] and (a(X ), a′ (X )) ∈ Rα,β , we deﬁne
f (X )(cid:0)a(X ), a′ (X )(cid:1) = (cid:0)f (X )a(X ), f (X )a′ (X )(cid:1) ∈ Rα,β ;
where f (X ) is the reduction f (X ) = f (X ) (mod 2), and f (X )a(X ) ∈ Rα =
Z2 [X ]/hX α − 1i, i.e., we should take the residue of f (X )a(X ) mod X α − 1; the
same is true of f (X )a′(X ) ∈ R′
β = Z4 [X ]/hX β − 1i. In a word, Rα,β is a Z4 [X ]-
module. It is shown in [4] that Z2Z4 -additive cyclic codes in Zα
4 can be
identiﬁed with Z4 [X ]-submodules of Rα,β = Z2 [X ]/hX α − 1i × Z4 [X ]/hX β − 1i.
As is common in the discussion of usual cyclic codes, we write codewords of
a Z2Z4 -additive cyclic code C as vectors or as polynomials interchangeably. In
either case, we use the same notation C to denote the set of all codewords. We
follow this convention in the rest of the paper.

3 A class of Z2Z4−additive cyclic codes

From now on, we always assume that m is an odd positive integer. For funda-
mentals on ﬁnite rings and coding theory, please refer to [18, 20].

Following Section 2, we denote

Rm = Z2 [X ]/hX m − 1i,

R′
m = Z4 [X ]/hX m − 1i,

2Z4 = {0, 2} ⊂ Z4 .

2 × Zm

We have seen that a subgroup C of Zm
4 is a Z2Z4 -additive cyclic code if
and only if C is a Z4 [X ]-submodule of Rm × R′
m . These codes are a special class
of Z2Z4 -additive cyclic codes. We call such codes by Z2Z4 -additive cyclic codes
with cycle length m.
Now we construct a class of Z4 [X ]-submodules of Rm × R′
m . Let
m = (cid:8)a′ (X ) =
i(cid:9),
2R′
a′
iX i ∈ R′
m : 2 | a′
which is an ideal of R′
m , i.e., a Z4 [X ]-submodule of R′
m . From the group homo-
morphism Eqn (2.5), we have a Z4 [X ]-module isomorphism from Rm onto 2R′
as follows:

Both Rm and 2R′
m are in fact Z2 [X ]-modules (and moreover, they are Rm -
modules), the above is a Z2 [X ]-isomorphism (moreover, an Rm -isomorphism).
Thus, Rm × 2R′
m is a Z4 [X ]-submodule of Rm × R′
m . Hence any Z2 [X ]-
submodule of Rm × 2R′
m , i.e., any Rm -submodule of Rm × 2R′
m , is a Z4 [X ]-
submodule of Rm × R′
m .
Each element of Rm × 2R′
m is uniquely represented as
(cid:0)a(X ), 2b(X )(cid:1) with a(X ) =
Any Rm -submodule of Rm × 2R′
m is generated by at most two elements. There
are submodules of it which cannot be generated by one element. For example,
Rm × 2R′
m as an Rm -submodule can not be generated by one element, because:
any Rm -module generated by one element is of dimension over Z2 at most m.
For any given (cid:0)a(X ), b(X )(cid:1) ∈ Rm × Rm , let
Ca,b = (cid:8)(cid:0)f (X )a(X ), 2f (X )b(X )(cid:1) ∈ Rm × 2R′
m (cid:12)(cid:12) f (X ) ∈ Rm(cid:9),
which is obviously an Rm -submodule of Rm × 2R′
m , hence is a Z4 [X ]-submodule
of Rm × R′
m ; in other words, Ca,b is a Z2Z4 -additive cyclic code in Rm × R′
generated by one element (cid:0)a(X ), b(X )(cid:1). Since Ca,b is an Rm -module, it is a
Z2 -vector space, and its dimension is denoted by dim Ca,b . We will exhibit good
algebraic structures and good asymptotic properties of the Z2Z4 -additive cyclic
codes with cycle length m deﬁned above.
We show a way to construct a generator matrix of the code Ca,b in Eqn (3.2).
Recall that the element (cid:0)a(X ), 2b(X )(cid:1) ∈ Rm × 2R′
m is always identiﬁed with
the word
(a0 , a1 , · · · , am−2 , am−1 , 2b0 , 2b1 , · · · , 2bm−2 , 2bm−1) ∈ Zm
We write

a(X ) = a0 + a1X + · · · + am−1X m−1 ,
b(X ) = b0 + b1X + · · · + bm−1X m−1 .
For a(X ) we have an m-dimensional vector (a0 , a1 , · · · , am−2 , am−1 ), from which
a circulant m × m matrix is constructed as follows:

and ha,b (X ) =

Then we can construct an m × 2m matrix:
bA = (cid:0) A 2B (cid:1)m×2m .
And it is easy to see that
Ca,b = (cid:8)(y0 , y1 · · · , ym−1 ) bA ∈ Zm
4 (cid:12)(cid:12) (y0 , y1 · · · , ym−1 ) ∈ Zm
2 (cid:9).
However, bA is not a generator matrix of Ca,b in general, since it is not of rank m
in general. To get a generator matrix from bA, we state a theorem as follows,
where gcd(·, ·) denotes the greatest common divisor and deg f (X ) denotes the
degree of the polynomial.
Theorem 3.1. Given (a(X ), b(X )) ∈ Rm × Rm and Ca,b as in Eqn (3.2). Let
ga,b (X ) = gcd (cid:0)a(X ), b(X ), X m − 1(cid:1)
X m − 1
ga,b (X )
Let (cid:10)ga,b (X )(cid:11)Rm
deg ha,b (X ), and there is an Rm -module isomorphism (cid:10)ga,b (X )(cid:11)Rm
be the ideal of Rm generated by ga,b(X ). Then dim Ca,b =
∼= Ca,b which
maps c(X ) ∈ (cid:10)ga,b(X )(cid:11)Rm
to (cid:0)c(X )a(X ), 2c(X )b(X )(cid:1) ∈ Ca,b .
Proof. The following map is clearly an Rm -module homomorphism:
f (X ) 7−→ (cid:0)f (X )a(X ), 2f (X )b(X )(cid:1).
γa,b : Rm −→ Rm × 2R′
m ,
Obviously, the image im(γa,b ) = Ca,b . Next we compute the kernel ker(γa,b ).
For f (X ) ∈ Rm , f (X ) ∈ ker(γa,b ) if and only if in Z2 [X ] we have
(cid:26)f (X )a(X ) ≡ 0 (mod X m − 1),
f (X )b(X ) ≡ 0 (mod X m − 1).
The two equations are combined into one equation in Z2 [X ]:
f (X ) gcd (cid:0)a(X ), b(X )(cid:1) ≡ 0 (mod X m − 1),
from which we see that the system (3.5) holds if and only if
(cid:0)mod
f (X ) ≡ 0
So we get that ker(γa,b ) = (cid:10)ha,b (X )(cid:11)Rm
. Since m is odd, Rm is semisimple,
i.e., X m − 1 has no repeated (multiple) roots in any extension of Z2 . Then we
obtain a direct sum decomposition of Rm as follows:
Rm = (cid:10)ha,b (X )(cid:11)Rm
⊕ (cid:10)ga,b(X )(cid:11)Rm
Then the above Rm -homomorphism γa,b induces an Rm -isomorphism:
γ a,b : (cid:10)ga,b (X )(cid:11)Rm
c(X ) 7−→ (cid:0)c(X )a(X ), 2c(X )b(X )(cid:1).
In particular,
dim Ca,b = dim (cid:10)ga,b (X )(cid:11)Rm
= m − deg ga,b(X ) = deg ha,b(X ).

Corollary 3.2. Let Ca,b , ha,b (X ) be as in Theorem 3.1 and r = deg ha,b (X ),
let bA be as in Eqn (3.3). Then the matrix consisting of the ﬁrst r rows of bA is
a generator matrix of Ca,b .
Proof. From the above theorem, we see that the rank of bA is equal to r.
And by [16, Theorem 3.6], the ﬁrst r rows of bA are linearly independent.
Example 3.3. Take m = 3, a(X ) = (X + 1)2 = X 2 + 1 and b(X ) = X + 1. By
Theorem 3.1,
ga,b(X ) = gcd (cid:0)a(X ), b(X ), X 3 − 1(cid:1) = X + 1;
ha,b (X ) = (X 3 − 1)/ga,b(X ) = X 2 + X + 1.
So dim Ca,b = 2. Using the notations in Eqn (3.3), we have

ga,b (X ) = gcd (cid:0)a(X ), b(X ), X 3 − 1(cid:1) = 1;
ha,b (X ) = (X 3 − 1)/ga,b(X ) = X 3 − 1.

Recall that m is odd, for X m − 1 = (X − 1)(X m−1 + · · · + X + 1), we get
Rm = Z2 [X ]/hX m − 1i = hX m−1 + · · · + X + 1iRm ⊕ hX − 1iRm ,
where hX m−1 + · · · + X + 1iRm is the trivial code of dimension 1. Thus, in the
following we consider the following ideal of Rm generated by X − 1:

(3.6)

Jm = hX − 1iRm ,

(3.7)

which is called the augmentation ideal of Rm in the representation theory of
ﬁnite groups. Similarly, in R′
m = Z4 [X ]/hX m − 1i we denote J ′
m = hX − 1iR′
m .
It is easy to see that 2J ′
m = {2f (X ) | f (X ) ∈ J ′

(3.8)

For the code Ca,b constructed in Eqn (3.2) where a(X ), b(X ) chosen from
Rm , in the following we will consider only the a(X ), b(X ) chosen from Jm . In
that case when a(X ), b(X ) ∈ Jm , by Theorem 3.1, the Z2Z4 -additive cyclic code
Ca,b with cycle length m can be reformulated within Jm as follows:
Ca,b = (cid:8)(c(X )a(X ), 2c(X )b(X )) ∈ Rm × 2R′
m (cid:12)(cid:12) c(X ) ∈ Jm(cid:9) ⊆ Jm × 2J ′
m . (3.9)
The class of the Z2Z4 -additive cyclic code Ca,b (of cycle length m) for
a(X ), b(X ) ∈ Jm will play a key role in the next section.
Lemma 3.5. Let notation be as above, let (cid:0)a(X ), b(X )(cid:1) ∈ Jm × Jm . Then
dim Ca,b ≤ m − 1; and dim Ca,b < m − 1 if and only if there is an irreducible fac-
tor p(X ) of X m−1 + · · · + X + 1 in Z2 [X ] such that p(X ) | a(X ) and p(X ) | b(X ).
Proof. By the deﬁnition of Jm in Eqn (3.7) we have
(X − 1) (cid:12)(cid:12) ga,b (X ) = gcd (cid:0)a(X ), b(X ), X m − 1(cid:1);
where ga,b(X ) is deﬁned in Eqn (3.4). So
(cid:10)ga,b (X )(cid:11)Rm
⊆ (cid:10)X − 1(cid:11)Rm
= Jm .
By Theorem 3.1, dim Ca,b = dim (cid:10)ga,b(X )(cid:11)Rm
≤ dim Jm = m − 1. And,
dim Ca,b = m − 1 if and only if
ga,b(X ) = gcd (cid:0)a(X ), b(X ), X m − 1(cid:1) = X − 1,
if and only if there is no irreducible factor p(X ) of Xm−1
X−1 such that p(X ) | a(X )
and p(X ) | b(X ).

Lemma 3.6. Let ℓm be the minimal degree of irreducible factors in Z2 [X ] of
X−1 , and d be an integer with ℓm ≤ d < m. Then any non-zero ideal of Rm
contained in Jm is of dimension at least ℓm , and the number of the ideals of
dimension d which are contained in Jm is at most m

d
ℓm .

X−1

Proof. By the decomposition in Eqn (3.6) and the deﬁnition of Jm in
Eqn (3.7), each irreducible ideal contained in Jm is corresponding to exactly
one irreducible divisor of Xm−1
such that the dimension of the ideal is equal
to the degree of the corresponding divisor. Thus, the minimal dimension of
the ideals contained in Jm is equal to ℓm . And, any d-dimensional ideal con-
tained in Jm is a sum of at most d/ℓm irreducible ideals. So the number of the
d-dimensional ideals contained in Jm is at most the partial sum of binomial co-
i (cid:1), where h is the number of the irreducible ideals contained
eﬃcients P⌊d/ℓm ⌋
in Jm and ⌊d/ℓm⌋ denotes the largest integer which is not larger than d/ℓm . It

4 Random Z2Z4−additive cyclic codes

Keep the notations in Section 2.
For a real number x with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, let H (x) = −x log2 x− (1− x) log2 (1− x)
with the convention that 0 logq 0 = 0. The function H (x) is called the (binary)
entropy. Note that H (x) is a strictly increasing concave function in the interval
[0, 1/2] with H (0) = 0 and H (1/2) = 1, see [18, §2.10.6]. In the following, we
assume that δ is a real number such that

0 < δ < 1/3

and

H (3δ/2) < 1/2.

(4.1)

Note that, if x ∈ [0, 1/2] such that H (x) = 1/2, then 0.11 < x < 0.1101. So the
assumption (4.1) is about to say that 0 < δ ≤ 0.0733.
As in Section 3, we denote

Rm = Z2 [X ]/hX m − 1i,

R′
m = Z4 [X ]/hX m − 1i,

and (see Eqn (3.7) and Eqn (3.8))

Jm = hX − 1iRm ,

2J ′
m = h2(X − 1)iR′
m = {2b(X ) | b(X ) ∈ Jm}.

m

In this section we view the set Jm × 2J ′
m as a probability space, whose samples
are aﬀorded with equal probability. For each sample (cid:0)a(X ), 2b(X )(cid:1) ∈ Jm × 2J ′
(with b(X ) ∈ Jm ), by Eqn (3.9) we have a Z2Z4−additive cyclic code with cycle
length m:
Ca,b = (cid:8)(c(X )a(X ), 2c(X )b(X )) ∈ Rm × 2R′
m (cid:12)(cid:12) c(X ) ∈ Jm(cid:9).
(4.2)
Then Ca,b is a random code over the probability space Jm × 2J ′
m , hence the
relative minimum distance ∆(Ca,b ) of Ca,b (see Eqn (2.3)) and the dimension
interested in the asymptotic properties of the probabilities Pr (cid:0)∆(Ca,b ) > δ(cid:1) and
dim(Ca,b ) of Ca,b are random variables over the probability space. We are
Pr (cid:0) dim Ca,b = m − 1(cid:1). As a preparation, we introduce a type of 0-1-variables.
Recall that a random variable is called a Bernoul li variable if it takes the
value 1 with probability p and the value 0 with probability 1 − p. Given any
c(X ) ∈ Jm . We deﬁne a Bernoulli variable Yc over the probability space Jm ×
m as follows: for samples (cid:0)a(X ), 2b(X )(cid:1) ∈ Jm × 2J ′
2J ′
m ,
Yc = (1, 1 ≤ wt(cid:0)c(X )a(X ), 2c(X )b(X )(cid:1) ≤ 3mδ ;
0, otherwise.
Since c(X ) ∈ Jm , the set {c(X )a(X ) ∈ Rm | a(X ) ∈ Jm } is the ideal of Rm
generated by c(X ), we denote it by Ic and denote its dimension by dc , i.e.,
Ic = (cid:10)c(X )(cid:11)Rm
By |S | we denote the cardinality of any set S .
Lemma 4.1. Let notation be as in Eqns (4.1)–(4.4). For Ic × Ic ⊆ Rm × Rm ,
let
(Ic × Ic )≤3mδ = (cid:8)(cid:0)f (X ), g (X )(cid:1) ∈ Ic × Ic (cid:12)(cid:12) wtH (cid:0)f (X ), g (X )(cid:1) ≤ 3mδ(cid:9).
Then

dc = dim Ic .

⊆ Jm ,

(4.3)

(4.4)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(Ic × Ic )≤3mδ (cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ 22dcH (3δ/2) .

Proof. Note that the length of the code Ic × Ic is 2m, i.e., dim(Rm × Rm) =
2m. And the dimension dim(Ic × Ic ) = 2dc . The fraction of 3mδ over the length
is (3mδ)/(2m) = 3δ/2, and by the assumption Eqn (4.1), 0 < 3δ/2 < 1/2. So
the inequality follows immediately from [14, Remark 3.2 and Corollary 3.5].
With the notation as in Eqns (4.1)–(4.4), we show an estimation of the
expectation E(Yc ) of the random variable Yc for later quotation.

Lemma 4.2. E(Yc ) ≤ 2−2dc+2dcH (3δ/2) .

Proof.

In 2J ′
m ⊂ R′
m , we have an ideal
c = (cid:10)2c(X )(cid:11)R′
I ′

m

= {2c(X )b(X ) ∈ R′
m | b(X ) ∈ Jm} ⊆ 2J ′
m .

11

By Eqn (3.8), we see that:

I ′

c

∼= Ic ,

and

dim I ′
c = dim Ic = dc .

(4.5)

For Ic × I ′
c ⊆ Rm × R′
m , we denote
(Ic × I ′
c )≤3mδ = (cid:8)(cid:0)f (X ), 2g (X )(cid:1) ∈ Ic × I ′
c (cid:12)(cid:12) wt(cid:0)f (X ), 2g (X )(cid:1) ≤ 3mδ(cid:9).
Since Yc is a 0-1-variable, the expectation of Yc is just the probability that
Yc = 1, So
E(Yc ) = Pr(Yc = 1) = (cid:12)(cid:12)(Ic × I ′
c )≤3mδ (cid:12)(cid:12) − 1
.
(4.6)
|Ic × I ′
c |
For f (X ), g (X ) ∈ Rm , we have seen that
wtL (2g (X )) = 2 wtH (g (X )),

where the weight in the left hand side is in R′
m , while the weight in the right
hand side is in Rm ; so

wt(f (X ), 2g (X )) ≥ wtH (f (X ), g (X )).

Thus, with notation in Lemma 4.1, we get
(cid:12)(cid:12)(Ic × I ′
c )≤3mδ (cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ (cid:12)(cid:12)(Ic × Ic )≤3mδ (cid:12)(cid:12).
By Eqn (4.6), Eqn (4.7), Eqn (4.5) and Lemma 4.1,
E(Yc ) ≤ (cid:12)(cid:12)(Ic × Ic )≤3mδ (cid:12)(cid:12)
≤
|Ic × Ic |
Now we can present an estimation of the probability that the relative mini-
mum distance ∆(Ca,b ) is at most δ .

22dc

= 2−2dc+2dcH (3δ/2) .

(4.7)

Lemma 4.3. Let δ be as in Eqn (4.1) and Ca,b be as in Eqn (4.2). Let ℓm be
the minimal degree of the irreducible divisors of Xm−1
X−1 as in Lemma 3.6. Then
ℓm (cid:1) .
Pr (cid:0)∆(Ca,b ) ≤ δ(cid:1) ≤
Proof. Let Yc for c(X ) ∈ Jm be the 0-1-variable deﬁned in Eqn (4.3). Let

2−2j(cid:0) 1
2 −H ( 3δ

m−1Xj=ℓm

2 )− log2 m

Y = Xc(X )∈Jm

Yc .

Then Y is a non-negative integer random variable over the probability space
Jm × 2J ′
m . By Eqn (4.2) and Eqn (4.3), Y stands for the number of c(X ) ∈ Jm

12

such that the codeword (cid:0)c(X )a(X ), 2c(X )b(X )(cid:1) of Ca,b is non-zero with weight
at most 3mδ . By Eqn (2.3), ∆(Ca,b ) = wt(Ca,b )/3m. We get
Pr (cid:0)∆(Ca,b ) ≤ δ(cid:1) = Pr (cid:0)Y > 0(cid:1).
By a Markov’s inequality [21, Theorem 3.1], Pr (cid:0)Y > 0(cid:1) ≤ E(Y ). So we can
prove the lemma by estimating the expectation E(Y ).
By the linearity of the expectation, E(Y ) = Pc(X )∈Jm
E(Yc ). For any ideal
I of Jm (we denote it by I ≤ Jm ), let I ∗ = (cid:8)c(X ) ∈ I (cid:12)(cid:12) Ic = I (cid:9), where Ic is
deﬁned in Eqn (4.4). That is,
I ∗ = (cid:8)c(X ) ∈ I (cid:12)(cid:12) dc = dim I (cid:9),
where dc = dim Ic , see Eqn (4.4). It is easy to see that Jm = SI≤Jm
I ∗ , where

Theorem 4.4. Let notation be as above. Assume that 0 < δ < 1/3 and
H (3δ/2) < 1/2. Then
Pr (cid:0)∆(C (i)
a,b ) > δ(cid:1) = 1.
Proof. By the assumption (i.e. the assumption in Eqn (4.1)), we have
2 − H ( 3δ

Theorem 4.5. Let m1 , m2 , · · · be positive integers satisfying Eqn (4.8), and

Pr (cid:0) dim C (i)
a,b = mi − 1(cid:1) = 1.
For any given i, let X mi−1 + · · · + X + 1 = p1 (X ) · · · phi (X )
be the irreducible decomposition in Z2 [X ], i.e., p1 (X ), · · · phi (X ) are distinct
irreducible polynomials in Z2 [X ]. By Chinese Remainder Theorem, there is a

Let a(X ), b(X ) ∈ Jmi . By Lemma 3.5, dim C (i)
a,b ≤ mi − 1, and dim C (i)
a,b < mi − 1
if and only if there is an index j with 1 ≤ j ≤ hi such that µ(j)
mi (a(X )) = 0 =
mi (b(X )). In other words, dim C (i)
a,b = mi −1 if and only if for any j = 1, · · · , hi ,
in Z2 [X ]/hpj (X )i × Z2 [X ]/hpj (X )i the following holds:
mi (a(X )), µ(j)
mi (b(X ))(cid:1) 6= (0, 0).
Let dj = deg pj (X ). Then Z2 [X ]/hpj (X )i is a ﬁnite ﬁeld of cardinality 2dj .
Note that µ(j)
: Jmi → Z2 [X ]/hpj (X )i is surjective homomorphism, cf.
the
isomorphism in Eqn (4.10). So the probability that Eqn (4.11) holds is equal to
22dj = 1− 2−2dj . Obviously, the events that Eqn (4.11) holds for j = 1, · · · , hi
are randomly independent. Thus
Pr (cid:0) dim C (i)
a,b = mi − 1(cid:1) =
By deﬁnition of ℓmi in Eqn (4.8), ℓmi ≤ dj for j = 1, · · · , hi , hence hi ≤ mi−1

Remark 4.7. For example, if we take H (3δ/2) = 0.4999, then δ ≈ 0.0733, and
we get a sequence C1 , C2 , · · · of Z2Z4 -additive cyclic codes with cycle length
going to inﬁnity such that R(Ci ) → 1/3, and ∆(Ci ) > 0.0733 for all i = 1, 2, · · · .

Remark 4.8. The probabilistic techniques used in this paper might be applied
to other families of codes, provided one could ﬁnd a class of codes in the family
which possess suitable properties such that the probabilistic method can work
well.
