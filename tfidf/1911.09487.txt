Abstract

Motivation: The biomedical
literature contains a wealth of chemical-protein interactions (CPIs).
Automatically extracting CPIs described in biomedical literature is essential for drug discovery, precision
medicine, as well as basic biomedical research. However, the existing methods do not consider the impact
of overlapping relations on CPI extraction. This leads to the extraction of sentences with overlapping
relations becoming the bottleneck of CPI extraction.
Results: In this paper, we propose a novel neural network-based approach to improve the CPI extraction
performance of sentences with overlapping relations. Speciﬁcally, the approach ﬁrst employs BERT to
generate high-quality contextual representations of the title sequence, instance sequence, and knowledge
sequence. Then, the Gaussian probability distribution is introduced to capture the local structure of the
instance. Meanwhile, the attention mechanism is applied to fuse the title information and biomedical
knowledge, respectively. Finally, the related representations are concatenated and fed into the softmax
function to extract CPIs. We evaluate our proposed model on the CHEMPROT corpus. Our proposed
model
is superior in performance as compared with other state-of-the-ar t models. The experimental
results show that the Gaussian probability distribution and external knowledge are complementary to
each other. Integrating them can effectively improve the CPI extraction performance. Fur thermore, the
Gaussian probability distribution can signiﬁcantly improve the extraction performance of sentences with
overlapping relations in biomedical relation extraction tasks.

1 Introduction

Knowledge of chemical-protein interactions (CPIs) is essential for drug
discovery, precision medicine, as well as basic biomedical research
(Krallinger et al., 2017). Currently, PubMed has included approximately
30 million articles and continues to grow at a rate of more than one
million articles per year. Extensive valuable CPI knowledge is hidden

in biomedical texts, and how to accurately and automatically extract these
interactions is increasingly attracting interest. Therefore, the automatic
extraction of CPIs from biomedical literature is becoming a crucial task
in biomedical natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Recently, the
BioCreative VI task organizers released a CHEMPROT corpus, which
is the ﬁrst corpus for CPI extraction (Krallinger et al., 2017).
Most existing CPI extraction methods can be roughly categorized
into two classes: statistical machine learning-based methods and neural

relations generates instances.

network-based methods. Statistical machine learning-based methods
usually exploit elaborate kernel functions or explicit feature engineering
to extract CPIs. For example, (Warikoo et al., 2018) utilized a linguistic
pattern-aware dependency tree kernel to extract CPIs, and their method
obtains an F-score of 36.54%. (Lung et al., 2019) constructed chemical-
protein relation (CPR) pairs and triplets and exploited sophisticated
features to implement CPI extraction. Their method achieves an F-score of
56.71%. In general, the performance of these methods depends heavily on
the designed kernel function and chosen feature set, which is an empirical
and skill-dependent work. Compared with statistical machine learning-
based methods, neural network-based methods can automatically learn
latent features and have become a dominant method for CPI extraction.
For example, (Corbett and Boyle, 2018) introduced transfer learning and
specialized word embeddings to extract CPIs, and their method obtains an
F-score of 61.41%. (Peng et al., 2018) proposed a method integrating a
support vector machine (SVM) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995), a convolutional
neural network (CNN) (Kim, 2014) and a recurrent neural network (RNN)
to extract CPIs. Their system achieves an F-score of 64.10%. (Sun
et al., 2019) attempted to improve the performance of CPI extraction
by introducing the entity attention mechanism and ELMo representations
(Peters et al., 2018) into the stacked bidirectional long short-term memory
(Bi-LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). Their method obtains
an F-score of 69.44%. Despite the success of these neural networks, some
disadvantages remain. First, the pre-trained word embeddings (Mikolov
et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014; Bojanowski et al., 2017) can only learn
a context-independent representation for each word (Peters et al., 2018).
Second, CNNs and RNNs perform distinctly worse than the self-attention
on word sense disambiguation (Tang et al., 2018). Recently, (Devlin
et al., 2019) proposed a language representation model called BERT,
which stands for bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers
(Vaswani et al., 2017). Compared with the previous neural network-
based models, BERT eschews the disadvantages of CNNs and RNNs
and addresses the drawbacks of pre-trained word embeddings. (Peng
et al., 2019) made a comprehensive comparison of various pre-trained
BERTs and introduced the biomedical language understanding evaluation
(BLUE) benchmark to facilitate research in the biomedical domain. In their
experiments, BERTs pre-trained on PubMed abstracts achieved a start-of-
the-art performance of CPI extraction, and the F-scores of BERTBASE
and BERTLARGE reach 72.5% and 74.4%, respectively. Overall, neural
network-based methods can automatically learn latent features from vast
amounts of unlabeled biomedical texts, thereby achieving start-of-the-art
performances of CPI extraction.
To date, research on CPI extraction is still at an early stage, and
the performance has much room to improve. As shown in Figure 1,
one sentence with overlapping relations will generate multiple identical

instances based on different
target entity pairs. For these identical
instances, we refer to them as overlapping instances. Correspondingly,
we refer to the sentences that have only one pair of target entities as
normal instances. Both the above-mentioned statistical machine learning-
based methods and neural network-based methods do not consider the
impact of overlapping instances. However, there are a large number of
overlapping instances in the CHEMPROT corpus, and the extraction of
these instances has become the bottleneck of CPI extraction. Existing
methods usually use position features (e.g., relative distance embeddings)
to indicate the position of each token in the instance, which can help the
model learn different latent information for overlapping instances to some
extent. Nevertheless, because the word/token sequence of the instance is
the major information for neural network-based methods (Zhang et al.,
2019b), it is difﬁcult to signiﬁcantly improve the extraction performance
of overlapping instances by using these position features. Even in the NLP
ﬁeld, the relation extraction of sentences with overlapping relations is
also a research difﬁculty. (Zeng et al., 2018) proposed an end2end neural
model based on the seq2seq learning framework with a copy mechanism
for relational fact extraction. (Takanobu et al., 2019) applied a hierarchical
reinforcement learning framework to enhance the interaction between
entity mentions and relation types. To the best of our knowledge, only
these two works have studied the extraction of overlapping relations by
jointly extracting both entity mentions and relation types, and there is
currently no work that focuses on the research of overlapping instances in
biomedical relation extraction tasks.
Our work focuses on improving the CPI extraction performance of
overlapping instances and starts from the following two aspects. On the
one hand, it is more reasonable that the relation extraction model should
focus on the target entity and its adjacent words than on treating each token
in the instance equally. Although the attention mechanism can use word
embeddings to calculate the weights, it cannot distinguish the importance
of the same word at different positions in the instance. Take the sentence in
Figure 1 as an example. The importance of these three ’agonist’ in different
instances is different, but the attention mechanism cannot distinguish them.
Therefore, we introduce the Gaussian probability distribution to enhance
the weights of the target entity and its adjacent words. On the other hand,
the CHEMPROT corpus is a corpus composed of abstracts from PubMed.
The title information and the knowledge from the biomedical knowledge
base may have a positive impact on CPI extraction. For example, in the
abstract ﬁle of the CHEMPROT corpus, the title "Loperamide modiﬁes
but does not block the corticotropin-releasing hormone-induced ACTH
response in patients with Addison’s disease" contains vital information on
the entities ’loperamide’ and ’ACTH’. This information may be helpful for
correctly predicting the interaction between these two entities. Moreover,
the Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) (Li et al., 2017) is a knowledge

CPI Extraction via Gaussian Probability Distribution and External Biomedical Knowledge

base to provide information about the known protein and the corresponding
chemicals directed at each target protein. We can use the knowledge from
TTD to generate CPR tags for instances. Therefore, we further leverage
the title information and biomedical knowledge (collectively referred to
as external knowledge) to guide CPI extraction.
In this paper, we propose a novel neural network-based approach
to improve the CPI extraction performance of overlapping instances.
Speciﬁcally, the approach ﬁrst employs BERT to generate high-quality
contextual representations of the title sequence,
instance sequence,
and knowledge sequence, respectively. Then the Gaussian probability
distribution is introduced to enhance the weights of the target entity and
its adjacent words in the instance sequence. Meanwhile, the attention
mechanism is applied to fuse the title information and biomedical
knowledge. Finally, the related representations are concatenated and fed
into the softmax function to extract CPIs. The contributions of our study
are three-fold.
• We propose a novel neural network-based approach to improve
the CPI extraction performance of overlapping instances. The
experimental results show that our proposed model can improve the
extraction performance of overlapping instances while maintaining the
performance of normal instances.
• We introduce the Gaussian probability distribution and external
knowledge into our proposed model to improve CPI extraction.
Through extensive experiments on the CHEMPROT corpus, we
demonstrate that the Gaussian probability distribution and external
knowledge are helpful for CPI extraction, and they are highly
complementary to each other.
• To the best of our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst study that
introduces the Gaussian probability distribution into biomedical
relation extraction tasks. Through extensive experiments on the
CHEMPROT and DDIExtraction 2013 corpora, we demonstrate that
the Gaussian probability distribution can effectively improve the
extraction performance of overlapping instances.

respectively. Finally, the related representations were concatenated and fed
into the softmax function to extract CPIs. In the following, our proposed
model will be described in detail.

2.2.1 BERT Representations

BERT is composed of a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer encoder.
For the input sequence, BERT uses the WordPiece tokenizer (Devlin et al.,
2019) to alleviate the out-of-vocabulary problem to a certain extent. The
ﬁrst token of every sequence is always a special token ’CLS’, and the
ﬁnal hidden state corresponding to this token is used as the sequence
representations for classiﬁcation tasks. More details about BERT can be
found in the study (Devlin et al., 2019).
BERT uses the ﬁnal hidden state of the token ’CLS’ to represent the
whole sequence representation. However, we argue that the ﬁnal hidden
states of the remaining tokens also contain valuable information. As a
result, we retain all ﬁnal hidden states of the tokens in the sequence.
Given an sequence (Si = {w1 , · · · , wi , · · · , wN }) as input, BERT can
be formulated as follows:

h0
i = Wewi + Wb
i = transf ormer_block(hl−1
hl
tL
i = hL

i

)

(1)

(2)

(3)

i
Rseq = hL
CLS

(4)
where wi is the i-th token, L is the total number of layers for BERT, l
(1 ≤ l ≤ L) is the l-th layer, and N denotes the sequence length. Equation
1 indicates input embeddings, Equation 3 denotes the representation of
the i-th token, and Equation 4 denotes the representations of the sequence.
The transformer_block in Equation 2 contains multi-head attention layers,
fully connected layers, and the output layer. Furthermore, the parameters
We , Wb , and transformer_block are pre-trained on large-scale corpora
using two unsupervised pre-training tasks, masked language model and
next sentence prediction. In the experiments, the input of our proposed
model is the title sequence, instance sequence and knowledge sequence.
We use BERT to generate these representations, where Qt , Qk , Rins
and ui denote the title sequence representations, the knowledge sequence
representations, the instance sequence representations and the instance
token representations, respectively.

CPI extraction is a task for detecting whether a speciﬁed CPR type
between the target chemical-protein pair within a sentence or document
and if so, classifying the CPR type. The CHEMPROT corpus contains
ﬁve types (i.e., âŁ™CPR:3âŁ™, âŁ™CPR:4âŁ™, âŁ™CPR:5âŁ™,
âŁ™CPR:6âŁ™ and âŁ™CPR:9âŁ™) used for evaluation purposes.
Therefore, we formulate CPI extraction into a multi-class classiﬁcation
problem (including the false relation). The classiﬁcation problem is deﬁned
as follows: given the instances {x1 , · · · , xi , · · · , xn }, the goal is to
classify the relation r for xi . Essentially, our proposed model is to estimate
the probability P (r|xi ), where R = {CPR:3, CPR:4, CPR:5, CPR:6,
CPR:9 and False}, r ∈ R, 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

2.2.2 Gaussian Probability Distribution Operation

In the CHEMPROT dataset, we found that there are a total of 19,460,
11,820 and 16,943 instances in the training set, development set and
test set, respectively. However, of these instances, only 915, 517 and
811 instances are normal instances, and the others are all overlapping
instances. These overlapping instances have the same sentence structure,
which makes it difﬁcult for existing methods to accurately extract their
CPR types. Therefore, we introduce the Gaussian probability distribution
to enhance the weights of the target entity and its adjacent words, so
that the model can learn the local structure of the instance. The Gaussian
probability density function is:

2.2 Model Architecture

Figure 2 is a schematic overview of our proposed model. Overall, our
model consists of three parts: BERT representations, Gaussian probability
distribution operation and external knowledge acquisition. The input of our
model is the title sequence, instance sequence, and knowledge sequence.
We ﬁrst used BERT to generate high-quality contextual representations of
these sequences, respectively. Then the Gaussian probability distribution
was introduced to enhance the weights of the target entity and its adjacent
words in the instance sequence. Meanwhile, the attention mechanism
was applied to fuse the title information and biomedical knowledge,

window to w = 1 to represent the distance of each token itself, and set the
optimal values of µ and δ to 0 and 3, respectively.
Figure 3 illustrates the Gaussian probability distribution operation
process for tokens in the instance. We ﬁrst numbered the tokens according
to the two target entities in the instance, thus obtaining two token relative
distance lists (x1 and x2 in Figure 3). Then we used the Gaussian
probability distribution function to calculate the probability of each token
in the instance. Afterwards, these token probabilities were performed

element-wise multiplication with the token representations. Finally,
we obtained the ﬁrst and second target-entity-aware representations,
respectively. The formula is as follows:

where N is the sequence length, x1 and x2 are token numbers, and Rtar1
and Rtar2 denote the ﬁrst and second target-entity-aware representations,
respectively.

2.2.3 External Knowledge Acquisition

In this study, we used the title information and biomedical knowledge
to improve the performance of CPI extraction. For the title information
acquisition, we ﬁrst employed BERT to generate high-quality contextual
representations of the title sequence. Then we applied the attention
mechanism to calculate the query of the title sequence and the key-value
pairs of the instance sequence, thereby incorporating the title information
into our proposed model. The title fusion attention is deﬁned as follows:

CPI Extraction via Gaussian Probability Distribution and External Biomedical Knowledge

Figure 4 illustrates the process for obtaining the biomedical knowledge
sequence. We ﬁrst obtained the CPR tags from TTD based on the target
chemical and protein entities of the instances, which we denote by K .
To improve the quality of K , we only obtained the tags of the ’CPR:4’,
’CPR:5’ and ’CPR:6’ types and eliminated the ambiguous CPR tags.
Then, we extended K by including tokens in the shortest dependency
path (SDP) from the target chemical and protein entities. Thus, we used
K as the knowledge sequence. More details on the knowledge sequence
acquisition are provided in Supplementary Material: Knowledge Sequence
Acquisition. Afterwards, we also employed BERT to generate high-
quality contextual representations of the knowledge sequence. Finally,
the attention mechanism is applied to calculate the query of K and the
key-value pairs of the instance sequence. The knowledge fusion attention
is deﬁned as follows:

ki = QT

where N is the sequence length, Qk is the representations of the knowledge
sequence, ui is the representation of the i-th token, and Rknow denotes
the fused knowledge representations.

Fig. 4. The process for obtaining the biomedical knowledge sequence.

2.2.4 Fusion and Classiﬁcation

In the fusion layer, the related representations are concatenated as the

fusion representations h (h = [Rtitle ; Rins ; Rtar1 ; Rtar2 ; Rknow ]).

Then a fully connected neural network is employed to learn the
representations h. Finally, the softmax function is used to calculate the
probability P belonging to the CPR type r :

P (r |h) = sof tmax(Wo h + bo )

(16)

where Wo and bo are weight parameters and bias parameters. Furthermore,
our proposed model uses the categorical cross-entropy function as the loss
function and utilizes Adam to optimize the parameters.

3 Experiments and Discussion

3.1 Dataset and Experimental Settings

In this study, to make a fair comparison with other methods, we used the
BLUE CHEMPROT dataset provided by (Peng et al., 2019) to evaluate
our proposed model. More detailed descriptions of the CHEMPROT
dataset are provided in Supplementary Material: CHEMPROT Dataset.
The only difference between our instance with Peng’s is that we replaced
the corresponding chemical and gene mentions with ’@CHEMPROT$’
and ’@GENE$’, respectively. For example, as shown in Figure 1, the
fourth instance is processed as "PEA was a potent and full agonist at
each species of @CHEMICAL$, whereas @GENE $ was a full agonist for
the rodent TAAR1s but was a partial agonist at h-rChTAAR1." in Peng’s
instance, but the instance is more reasonable to be processed into our
instance "PEA was a potent and full agonist at each species of @GENE $,
whereas @CHEMICAL$ was a full agonist for the rodent TAAR1s but was
a partial agonist at h-rChTAAR1.". The statistics of evaluated CPR types
in the CHEMPROT dataset are illustrated in Table 1.

In the experiments, we employed the PyTorch (https://pytorch.org/)
framework to implement our proposed model. For the BERT model, we
used the BERTBASE pre-trained on PubMed provided by (Peng et al.,
2019). The performance of other BERTs was also tested, but no better
performance was achieved. The results are provided in Supplementary
Material: Performance of BERTs. We used the training set to train our
proposed model and utilized the development set to choose the appropriate
hyper-parameters. The test set was only used to evaluate the model.
The hyper-parameter settings are consistent throughout this study, and
the details are provided in Supplementary Material: Hyper-parameter
Settings. Because most existing methods used precision, recall and F1-
score as metrics, we evaluated our proposed model in the same way. The
formula is: F -score = 2P R/(P + R), where P denotes the precision and
R denotes the recall, respectively.

3.2 Experimental Results

In this section, we ﬁrst compared our approach with other state-of-the-
art methods on the CHEMPROT corpus. Table 2 shows the experimental
results of different methods in detail. The ﬁrst two methods are based
on statistical machine learning. These methods exploited a tree kernel
function or feature engineering to construct a classiﬁer to implement
CPI extraction. However, the performance of these two methods is not
satisfactory. This indicates that it is difﬁcult to effectively achieve CPI
extraction on the CHEMPROT corpus using statistical machine learning-
based methods. In addition to the ﬁrst two methods, the others are all
neural network-based methods. It can be observed from Table 2 that
neural network-based methods generally achieve better performance than
statistical machine learning-based methods. In these neural network-based
methods,
the ﬁrst four methods utilized ensemble methods to obtain
better performance. However, the individual model (e.g., CNNs or RNNs)
still has much room for improvement. (Lu et al., 2019) attempted to
improve the performance by using a granular attention mechanism to

enhance the RNN model. (Zhang et al., 2019a) exploited the multi-head
attention mechanism and ELMo representations to improve CPI extraction.
(Sun et al., 2019) introduced the entity attention mechanism and ELMo
representations into the stacked Bi-LSTM to improve the performance
of CPI extraction. These three methods are all single models and obtain
competitive performance on CPI extraction. Recently, BERT raised the
F-score to a new level, which demonstrates the success of the language
representation model. Our approach exploited BERT to generate high-
quality contextual representations and introduced the Gaussian probability
distribution and external knowledge to enhance the extraction ability of
the model. Our proposed model obtains an F-score of 76.03%, which is
currently the best performance. These experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed model can effectively improve the performance of CPI
extraction.
Then, we compared the performance of each evaluated CPR
type. Compared with other models, our proposed model achieves the
highest F-scores on the ’CPR:3’, ’CPR:4’, ’CPR:5’ and ’CPR:9’ types,
respectively. This experimental result demonstrates the effectiveness
of our proposed model. On the other hand,
it can be observed that
the extraction performance of different CPR types varies signiﬁcantly.
We can see all methods achieve relatively high performance on the
’CPR:3’, âŁ™CPR:4âŁ™, âŁ™CPR:5âŁ™ and âŁ™CPR:6âŁ™ types.
The reason may be that these four CPR types have obvious recognition
words (e.g., ’activator’, ’inhibitor’, ’agonist’ and ’antagonist’) in the
instance, so it is easier for the model to extract these types of chemical-
protein interactions. In contrast, all methods have relatively low F-scores
on the ’CPR:9’ type. This suggests that it is the most challenging to
accurately extract the ’CPR:9’ type chemical-protein interactions on the
CHEMPROT corpus. According to our observations, the ’CPR:9’ type
has no obvious recognition words in the instance. Moreover, from Table
2, we can see that the training set for the ’CPR:9’ type only contains 727
instances. Therefore, the worse extraction performance on the ’CPR:9’
type may be caused by an insufﬁcient number of the ’CPR:9’ instances
in the training set. Despite this, our proposed model is still superior to
other models on the extraction of the ’CPR:9’ type. This demonstrates the
effectiveness of our proposed model from another aspect.
In conclusion, the experimental results show that our proposed model
is superior in performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods
used for CPI extraction. Due to space limitations, the error analysis of our
proposed model is provided in Supplementary Material: Error Analysis.

3.3 Extraction of Overlapping and Normal Instances

In this section, we explored the impact of our proposed model on
overlapping instances and normal instances. Table 3 shows the statistics

for the instances in the CHEMPROT dataset. There are 19,460, 11,820 and
16,943 instances in the training set, development set and test set, of which
18,545, 11,303 and 16,132 instances are overlapping instances. However,
the existing methods do not consider the impact of these instances on
CPI extraction. This leads to the extraction of overlapping instances
becoming the bottleneck for CPI extraction. Unlike the previous works, our
proposed approach is designed to focus on these overlapping instances by
introducing the Gaussian probability distribution and external knowledge.
We performed comparative experiments to explore the reason for the CPI
performance improvement of our proposed model. In the comparative
experiments, we ﬁrst used overlapping instances and normal instances
in the test set as input, and then compared the performance of BERT
with the performance of our proposed model (the input of our proposed
model also contains the title sequence and knowledge sequence). As
shown in Table 4, BERT obtains F-scores of 73.62% and 83.28% in the
extraction of overlapping instances and normal instances, respectively.
Correspondingly, our proposed model achieves F-scores of 75.40% and
82.84%, respectively. These experimental results show that our proposed
model can improve the CPI performance of overlapping instances while
maintaining the performance of normal instances.

CPI Extraction via Gaussian Probability Distribution and External Biomedical Knowledge

3.4 Ablation Study

In this section, to explore the contribution of each component to overall
performance, we performed an ablation study over our proposed model
on the CHEMPROT test set. The experimental results are presented
in Table 5. We ﬁrst explored the impact brought by the Gaussian
probability distribution. We can see that removing the Gaussian probability
distribution hurts performance signiﬁcantly on CPI extraction. This
experimental result demonstrates that the Gaussian probability distribution
operation is critical in obtaining state-of-the-art performance. Next, we
evaluated the impact of external knowledge (i.e., the title information
and biomedical knowledge). When the title sequence or knowledge
sequence is removed, the F-score of the model decreases by 1.49% and
1.46%, respectively. However, when the title sequence and knowledge
sequence are both removed, the F-score of the model drops only 0.78%.
These experimental results indicate that both the title information and
biomedical knowledge contribute to our proposed model, and the two
external knowledge are complementary. Finally, we validated the effects of
Gaussian probability distribution and external knowledge. When removing
the Gaussian probability distribution and external knowledge, our
proposed model degenerates into the BERT model, and the performance
drops to 74.45% in F-score. These experimental results demonstrate that
the Gaussian probability distribution and external knowledge are helpful
for CPI extraction, and they are also highly complementary to each other.

3.5 Impact of Gaussian Probability Distribution on
Biomedical Relation Extraction

In this study, we introduced the Gaussian probability distribution
into biomedical relation extraction tasks. When removing the external
knowledge, our proposed model degenerates into a ’BERT+Gaussian’
model. To explore the impact of Gaussian probability distribution
on biomedical
relation extraction tasks, we further evaluated the
’BERT+Gaussian’ model on the CHEMPROT and DDIExtraction 2013
(Herrero-Zazo et al., 2013; Segura-Bedmar et al., 2013) corpora.
DDIExtraction 2013 corpus is a manually annotated drug-drug interaction
(DDI) corpus based on the DrugBank database and MEDLINE abstracts.
This corpus contains four DDI types for evaluation purposes, namely
’Advice’,
’Effect’,
’Mechanism’ and ’Int’. We also formulate DDI
extraction into a multi-class classiﬁcation problem, and the evaluation
metrics of DDI are consistent with CPI, which are precision, recall and
F1-score. In the experiments, to fairly compare with existing methods,
we also used the BLUE DDIExtraction 2013 dataset provided by (Peng
et al., 2019) to evaluate the model. Table 6 illustrates the statistics for the
instances in the DDIExtraction 2013 dataset. More detailed descriptions of
the DDIExtraction 2013 dataset are provided in Supplementary Material:
DDIExtraction 2013 Dataset.
Table 7 shows the performance comparison on the DDIExtraction

method to integrate the SDP and sentence sequence for DDI extraction.
To the best of our knowledge,
their method achieved state-of-the-art
performance with an F-score of 72.9% before BERT appears. (Peng et al.,
2019) exploited BERT pre-trained on PubMed to extract DDIs and raised
the F-score to 78.1%. This experimental result demonstrates the success
of BERT on DDI extraction. We used BERT pre-trained on PubMed
to generate BERT representations, and employed the ’BERT+Gaussian’
model to extract DDIs. The ’BERT+Gaussian’ model obtains an F-score
of 81.54%, which is 3.44% higher than the corresponding BERT model.
This experimental result demonstrates the effectiveness of the Gaussian
probability distribution for DDI extraction.
Moreover, we further explored the impact of Gaussian probability
distribution on biomedical relation extraction. We exploited overlapping
instances and normal instances in the CHEMPROT or DDIExtraction
2013 test set as input, respectively. Then, we compared the performance
of BERT with the ’BERT+Gaussian’ model locally. As shown in Table
8, compared with BERT, the ’BERT+Gaussian’ model improves the
performance of overlapping instances by 0.95% and 2.70% in CPI and
DDI extraction, respectively. Through these experiments, we can infer
that the Gaussian probability distribution can signiﬁcantly improve the
performance of overlapping instances while maintaining the performance
of normal instances in biomedical relation extraction tasks.

4 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a novel neural network-based approach to
improve the performance of CPI extraction by introducing the Gaussian
probability distribution and external knowledge. We evaluate our proposed
model on the CHEMPROT corpus. It is encouraging to see that the
performance of our proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art
models, reaching an F-score of 76.03%. The experimental results show that
the Gaussian probability distribution and external knowledge are highly
complementary to each other. Integrating them can effectively improve
the CPI extraction performance. Furthermore, the Gaussian probability
distribution can signiﬁcantly improve the extraction performance of
overlapping instances in biomedical relation extraction tasks.
Although our proposed approach exhibits promising performance for
CPI extraction from biomedical literature, there is still some room to
improve. In particular, our proposed approach does not obtain a high F-
score on the ’CPR:9’ type, likely because of insufﬁcient training data. This
indicates that our proposed approach depends on high-quality training
data. In future work, we would like to explore the effectiveness of the
semi-supervised or unsupervised approach in CPI extraction.
